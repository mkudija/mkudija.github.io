<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p>Introduction</p>

<ul>
<li>"I realized that behind the soaring rhetoric of 'genius' and 'visionary' was a basic commitment to the principles of design thinking." (6)<br />
Chapter 1 - Getting Under Your Skin or how design thinking is about more than style</li>
<li>"Linear thinking is about sequences; mind maps are about connections." (9)</li>
<li>"spaces" of design thinking are iterative and nonlinear (16)
<ul>
<li>inspiration - the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions</li>
<li>ideation - the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas</li>
<li>implementation - the path that leads from the project room to the market</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Fail early to succeed sooner." (17)</li>
<li>"The mark of a designer is a willing embrace of constraints." (17) --> necessary to get started
<ul>
<li>constraints are viewed in terms of feasibility (functionally possible), viability (sustainable business model), and desirability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Project: Design thinkers need to think in terms of projects instead of problems: a project carries an idea from concept to reality (21)</li>
<li>The Brief: mental constraints to give you somewhere to start (22)</li>
<li>Smart Teams: "all of us are smarter than any of us" (26), organized in many small teams<br />
Chapter 2 - Converting need into demand or putting people first</li>
<li>Human-centered design has three elements:
<ul>
<li>Insight - learning from the lives of others</li>
<li>Observation - watching what people don't do and listening to what they don't say</li>
<li>Empathy - standing in the shoes of others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These principles must extend beyond the individual to the network, market, or "wisdom crowds"<br />
Chapter 3 - A mental matrix or "these people have no process!"</li>
<li>Types of thinking:
<ul>
<li>Convergent thinking - useful for deciding between existing alternatives (but not good at creating the future)</li>
<li>Divergent thinking - objective is to multiply options to create choices</li>
<li>Analysis - </li>
<li>Synthesis - organizing and interpreting data to create a coherent story; extracting meaningful patterns from raw data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rules for an attitude of experimentation
<ul>
<li>Best ideas emerge when the whole organization can experiment</li>
<li>Those most exposed to changing externalities are the best placed to respond</li>
<li>Ideas should not be favored based on who creates them</li>
<li>Ideas that create a buzz should be favored</li>
<li>Senior leadership should tend, prune, and harvest ideas --> "risk tolerance"</li>
<li>An overarching sense of direction should be articulated so there is a sense of direction and not a constant need for supervision</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Culture of optimism - the unshakable belief that things could be better than they are</li>
<li>Brainstorming - a structured way of breaking out of structure
<ul>
<li>Defer judgment</li>
<li>Encourage wild ideas</li>
<li>Stay focused on the topic</li>
<li>Build on the ideas of others<br /><br />
Chapter 4 - Building to think or the power of prototyping</li>
</ul></li>
<li>prototyping is faster because it helps you to think<br />
Chapter 5 - Returning to the surface or the design of experiences</li>
<li>a good idea is no longer enough - in developed societies we care about the experience of products</li>
<li>our society is moving away from passive consumption to active participation<br />
Chapter 6 - Spreading the message or the importance of storytelling</li>
<li>we rely on storytelling to put our ideas in context and give them meaning<br />
Chapter 7 - Design thinking meets the corporation or teaching to fish</li>
<li>a<br />
Chapter 8 - The new social contract, or we're all in this together</li>
<li>a<br />
Chapter 9 - Design activism, or inspiring solutions with global potential</li>
<li>a<br />
Chapter 10 - Designing tomorrow, today</li>
<li>Design thinking requires bridging the knowing-doing gap (Pfeffer and Sutton) (227)</li>
<li>most people have what it takes to apply design thinking to the problems of life</li>
<li>Begin at the Beginning
<ul>
<li>design thinking starts with divergence (expand the range of options)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take a human-centered approach
<ul>
<li>design thinking is by its nature integrative, but privileges the intended user</li>
<li>account for emotional meaning as well as functional performance</li>
<li>common approaches
<ul>
<li>Start with prevailing business constraints --> leads to incremental, easily-copied ideas</li>
<li>Start with technology --> risky</li>
<li>Start with humans --> increases the likelihood of a breakthrough and a market for it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get as close as you can to your intended customers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fail early, Fail often
<ul>
<li>there is nothing wrong with failure as long as it happens early and is a source of learning</li>
<li>prototyping</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get professional help
<ul>
<li>to to the experts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Share the inspiration
<ul>
<li>knowledge sharing should support inspiration instead of efficiency</li>
<li>face to face time is invaluable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blend big and small projects
<ul>
<li>there is no silver bullet, only silver buckshot</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Budget to the pace of innovation
<ul>
<li>rethink funding schedules, agile resource allocation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find talent any way you can
<ul>
<li>find the people in your organization who are different and can make innovation happen</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Design for the cycle
<ul>
<li>make sure your person career life cycles are not shorter than the product cycle: want the same people and passion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't ask what, ask why?
<ul>
<li>ask why to reframe a problem, redefine the constraints, and open the field to a more innovative answer</li>
<li>is this the right problem to be solving?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open your eyes
<ul>
<li>good design thinkers observe, great design thinkers observe the ordinary: once a day, stop and think about an ordinary situation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make it visual
<ul>
<li>record your observations and ideas visually</li>
<li>"Every designer I know carries a sketch pad the way a doctor carries a stethoscope." (238)</li>
<li>"Don't think.  Look." -Ludwig Wittgenstein (238)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build on the ideas of others
<ul>
<li>all of us are smarter than any of us</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Demand options
<ul>
<li>don't settle for the first good idea</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Balance your portfolio
<ul>
<li>document the process</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Design a life
<ul>
<li>think of life as a prototype</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
