<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li><em>genes</em> (information) encode <em>RNAs</em> to build <em>proteins</em> to form/regulate <em>organisms</em> that sense <em>environments</em> that influence <em>proteins/RNA</em> that regulate <em>genes</em> (163, 178, 258, 410)</li>
<li>"Three profoundly destabilizing scientific ideas ricochet through the twentieth century, trisecting it into three unequal parts: the atom, the byte, the gene. Each is foreshadowed by and earlier century, but dazzles into full prominence in the twentieth. (9)</li>
<li>"Hereditary identities borrowed from two organisms had been shuffled around to form a new one; it was as close to metaphysics as you could get." (214)</li>
<li>Victor McKusick: "mutations are just variations" (264)
<ul>
<li>disabilities are caused by and <em>incongruity</em> between an individual's genetic endowment and his or her current environment"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>discussion of <a href="../notes/Abortion.html">Abortion</a>:
<ul>
<li>"the division of pregnancy into trimesters was a biologically arbitrary invention" (268)</li>
<li>awful: "The 'right to be born' is being qualified by another right: to have a reasonable chance of a happy and useful life" —Joseph Dancis (269)</li>
<li>not logically coherent: "The court asserted that the right of a child to be born free of [genetic] anomalies is a fundamental right." (271)</li>
<li>but selective abortion based on genetic testing is just eugenics reborn (272)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Glory be to God for dappled things." —<em><a href="../notes/Pied-Beauty.html">Pied Beauty</a></em> by <a href="../notes/Gerard-Manley-Hopkins.html">Gerard Manley Hopkins</a> (278)</li>
<li>umm...no: "the moon rocket...was just a massive jet plane pointed vertically at the moon", but his point is that conceptual shifts are more important than scale shifts in scientific understanding (293)</li>
<li>Mitochondrial Eve: the common mother of all humanity (338)</li>
<li>humans are very similar genetically but we are culturally very inclined to exaggerate differences (343)</li>
<li>genetic variation is not absolute but good or bad depending on environment, i.e. dyslexia wasn’t an issue until people started to read </li>
<li>tragic and heartbraking story of a man (Paul Gelsinger) trying to get to his dying son (Jessie): he "walked a mile and a half through the whistling storm to the hospital to see Jesse in the ICU"</li>
<li>eugenics: "We would certainly eliminate Erika's mutation from the human gene pool—but we would eliminate Erika as well..." (452)</li>
<li>unpredictability of gene expression is a good reason to tread lightly in research</li>
<li>the worst eugenic atrocity is not Nazis but selectively killing baby girls in India and China</li>
<li>“Choice, in short, seems like an illusion decided by genes to ensure the propagation of similar genes” (458)</li>
</ul>
