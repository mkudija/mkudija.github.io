<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<ul>
<li>&gt;The God of all Providence, Who in the adorable designs of His love at first elevated the human race to the participation of the Divine nature, and afterwards delivered it from universal guilt and ruin, restoring it to its primitive dignity, has in consequence bestowed upon man a splendid gift and safeguard - making known to him, by supernatural means, the hidden mysteries of His Divinity, His wisdom and His mercy. For although in Divine revelation there are contained some things which are not beyond the reach of unassisted reason, and which are made the objects of such revelation in order "that all may come to know them with facility, certainty, and safety from error, yet not on this account can supernatural Revelation be said to be absolutely necessary; it is only necessary because God has ordinated man to a supernatural end." (1)</li>
<li>1 : <em>The importance of the study of Sacred Scripture because of their contents and origin.</em>
<ul>
<li>God has given us the gift of the mysteries of his Divinity </li>
<li>Divine Revelation is "necessary because God has ordinated man to a supernatural end"</li>
<li>Divine Revelation is "contained both in unwritten Tradition, and in written Books, which are therefore called sacred and canonical"</li>
<li>Sacred Scripture: "God, Who spoke first by the Prophets, then by His own mouth, and lastly by the Apostles, composed also the Canonical Scriptures, and that these are His own oracles and words - a Letter, written by our heavenly Father, and transmitted by the sacred writers to the human race in its pilgrimage so far from its heavenly country"</li>
<li>&gt;"If, then, such and so great is the excellence and the dignity of the Scriptures, that God Himself has composed them, and that they treat of God's marvellous mysteries, counsels and works, it follows that the branch of sacred Theology which is concerned with the defence and elucidation of these divine Books must be excellent and useful in the highest degree."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2: <em>This encyclical is to encourage and give direction to the study of Scripture.</em>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: "to impart to Scripture study a direction suitable to the needs of the present day"</li>
<li>Leo desires that Scripture be "safely and abundantly accessible to the flock of Jesus Christ" and that it be guarded against both impious assault and fallacious interpretation.</li>
<li>Leo exhorts those "from whose skill and piety and learning we have a right to expect good results" to the study of Scripture </li>
<li>Those in Holy Orders especially should "display greater diligence and industry in reading, meditating, and explaining" Scripture </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="holy-scripture-most-profitable-to-doctrine-and-morality">Holy Scripture Most Profitable To Doctrine and Morality</h3>

<ul>
<li>3: <em>The Holy Scripture is worthy of commendation because it is God's Word and because of the "innumerable benefits of which it is the source".</em>
<ul>
<li>The "homage which we owe to God's Word"</li>
<li>The "the innumerable benefits of which it is the source" (cf. <a href="../notes/2-Tm-03.html">2 Tm-03</a>-17)</li>
<li>Christ in his ministry, and then in his example the Apostles also, appealed to the Scriptures</li>
<li>Scripture is a "great arsenal of heavenly arms" to understand God, His Son, the Church, and a life of morality and discipline.</li>
<li>&gt;"Let all, therefore, especially the novices of the ecclesiastical army, understand how deeply the sacred Books should be esteemed, and with what eagerness and reverence they should approach this great arsenal of heavenly arms. For those whose duty it is to handle Catholic doctrine before the learned or the unlearned will nowhere find more ample matter or more abundant exhortation...Nowhere is there anything more full or more express on the subject of the Saviour of the world than is to be found in the whole range of the Bible. As St. Jerome says, 'To be ignorant of the Scripture is not to know Christ.'"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>4: <em>We ought to use Holy Scripture that our work and preaching might convey "fire of the utterance of God".</em>
<ul>
<li>The power of Holy Scripture arises from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. We ought to "infuse the spirit and strength of the Word of God" into our efforts and preaching (cf. <a href="../notes/1-Thes-01.html">1 Thes-01</a>, <a href="../notes/Heb-04.html">Heb-04</a>)</li>
<li>Scripture contains "an eloquence that is wonderfully varied and rich, and worthy of great themes"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>5: <em>The Holy Fathers exhort us to Scripture, which must be sought with humility and holiness</em>
<ul>
<li>The Fathers refer to Scripture as "an inexhaustible treasury of heavenly doctrine,"(Crysostom, Augustine), "an overflowing fountain of salvation," (Athanasius), and "fertile pastures and beautiful gardens in which the flock of the Lord is marvellously refreshed and delighted" (Augustine).</li>
<li>St. Jerome: "Often read the divine Scriptures; yea, let holy reading be always in thy hand; study that which thou thyself must preach...Let the speech of the priest be ever seasoned with Scriptural reading." (cf. Epistle to Nepotian)</li>
<li>St. Gregory the Great: "Those who are zealous in the work of preaching must never cease the study of the written word of God."</li>
<li>We must not just read, but <em>live</em>: we must "bring to this divine reading not only docility and attention, but also piety and an innocent life"</li>
<li>The truths of Scripture are "to be sought by humble prayer and guarded by holiness of life"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-the-bible-owes-to-the-catholic-church">What the Bible Owes to the Catholic Church</h3>

<ul>
<li>6: <em>Scripture is a "celestial treasure" interpreted interpreted by the Church and fed to her children.</em>
<ul>
<li>"The celestial treasure of the Sacred Books, so bountifully bestowed upon man by the Holy Spirit, should not lie neglected"</li>
<li>The Church has prescribed that Scripture be read in the daily office, expounded and interpreted by capable men, and fed to her children. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>7: <em>Traces the history of Scripture study from the fathers down to Aquinas.</em>
<ul>
<li>"From the beginning of Christianity, all who have been renowned for holiness of life and sacred learning have given their deep and constant attention to Holy Scripture."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>8: <em>Traces more recent history of Catholic biblical scholarship</em>
<ul>
<li>Study of Greek and the printing press gave a strong impetus to Biblical studies </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-study-holy-scripture">How to Study Holy Scripture</h3>

<ul>
<li>9: <em>Counsel for how to study the Bible</em></li>
<li>10: <em>Opposing views to contend with: sola scriptura and rationalism</em>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Sola-scriptura.html">Sola scriptura</a>: those who "held the Scriptures to be the one source of revelation and the final appeal in matters of Faith"</li>
<li>Rationalists: deny that there is any such thing as revelation or inspiration, "detestable errors", they "pervert the credulous and unformed minds of the young to the contempt of Holy Scripture"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>11: <em>Start with Seminary instruction, where teachers of Sacred Scripture "must be men whose character and fitness are proved by their love of, and their long familiarity with, the Bible, and by suitable learning and study"</em></li>
<li>12: <em>Proposes separate professors set aside for Sacred Scripture</em></li>
<li>13: <em>Twofold aim of instruction to "defend the sacred writings and to penetrate their meaning"</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: "how to prove the integrity and authority of the Bible, how to investigate and ascertain its true sense, and how to meet and refute objections"</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: "the method of using the word of God for the advantage of religion and piety" </li>
<li>Use the <a href="../notes/Vulgate.html">Vulgate</a>, which is the "authentic" version per <a href="../notes/Council-of-Trent.html">Trent</a>, as well as other ancient versions and the Hebrew and Greek.</li>
<li>Rely on "received and approved canons of interpretation", but not more than Scripture itself or in a way that overwhelms </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="holy-scripture-and-theology-interpretation-the-fathers">Holy Scripture and Theology; Interpretation; the Fathers</h3>

<ul>
<li>14: <em>We must interpret Scripture from the "heart of the Church", with proper deference to the Tradition and the Fathers</em>
<ul>
<li>"The sacred writings are wrapt in a certain religious obscurity, and that no one can enter into their interior without a guide," therefore we "must follow the Church as their guide and their teacher." (cf. <a href="../notes/Vatican-I.html">Vatican I</a>)</li>
<li>"This most wise decree the Church by no means prevents or restrains the pursuit of Biblical science, but rather protects it from error, and largely assists its real progress. A wide field is still left open to the private student, in which his hermeneutical skill may display itself with signal effect and to the advantage of the Church."</li>
<li>"All interpretation is foolish and false which either makes the sacred writers disagree one with another, or is opposed to the doctrine of the Church."</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Augustine.html">St. Augustine</a>: "If there is no branch of teaching, however humble and easy to learn, which does not require a master, what can be a greater sign of rashness and pride than to refuse to study the Books of the divine mysteries by the help of those who have interpreted them?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>15: <em>Priority in interpretation should be given literal and obvious sense, and we attention should be paid to first to ancient Catholic commentators</em>
<ul>
<li>We ought to "carefully observe the rule so wisely laid down by St. Augustine-not to depart from the literal and obvious sense, except only where reason makes it untenable or necessity requires."</li>
<li>The Liturgy is an embodiment of the interpretation of the Church in her tradition: "Neither should those passages be neglected which the Fathers have understood in an allegorical or figurative sense, more especially when such interpretation is justified by the literal, and when it rests on the authority of many. For this method of interpretation has been received by the Church from the Apostles, and has been approved by her own practice, as the holy Liturgy attests." (cf. <em><a href="2025-03-14-Letter-and-Spirit.html">Letter and Spirit</a></em>)</li>
<li>We should prioritize interpretation of Catholics, especially older interpretation: "It is most unbecoming to pass by, in ignorance or contempt, the excellent work which Catholics have left in abundance, and to have recourse to the works of non-Catholics - and to seek in them, to the detriment of sound doctrine and often to the peril of faith, the explanation of passages on which Catholics long ago have successfully employed their talent and their labour. For although the studies of non-Catholics, used with prudence, may sometimes be of use to the Catholic student, he should, nevertheless, bear well in mind—as the Fathers also teach in numerous passages—that the sense of Holy Scripture can nowhere be found incorrupt outside of the Church, and cannot be expected to be found in writers who, being without the true faith, only gnaw the bark of the Sacred Scripture, and never attain its pith."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>16: <em>Theology rests on Scripture, and Thomas should be our first guide.</em>
<ul>
<li>"The whole teaching of Theology should be pervaded and animated by the use of the divine Word of God."</li>
<li>"The Sacred Books hold such an eminent position among the sources of revelation that without their assiduous study and use, Theology cannot be placed on its true footing, or treated as its dignity demands."</li>
<li>Aquinas should be our guide to Scripture: "Care must be taken, then, that beginners approach the study of the Bible well prepared and furnished; otherwise, just hopes will be frustrated, or, perchance, what is worse, they will unthinkingly risk the danger of error, falling an easy prey to the sophisms and laboured erudition of the Rationalists. The best preparation will be a conscientious application to philosophy and theology under the guidance of <a href="../notes/St.-Thomas-Aquinas.html">St. Thomas of Aquin</a>, and a thorough training therein - as We ourselves have elsewhere pointed out and directed. By this means, both in Biblical studies and in that part of Theology which is called positive, they will pursue the right path and make satisfactory progress."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-authority-of-holy-scripture-modern-criticism-physical-science">The Authority of Holy Scripture; Modern Criticism; Physical Science</h3>

<ul>
<li>17: <em>Maintain the authority of Holy Scripture via the magisterium and honest historical study. It is proper to study the original languages of Scripture.</em>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the full authority of Holy Scripture "cannot be done completely or satisfactorily except by means of the living and proper <em>magisterium</em> of the Church."
<ul>
<li>But "the divine and infallible magisterium of the Church rests also on the authority of Holy Scripture."</li>
<li>Therefore, "first thing to be done is to vindicate the trustworthiness of the sacred records at least as human documents, from which can be clearly proved, as from primitive and authentic testimony, the Divinity and the mission of Christ our Lord, the institution of a hierarchical Church and the primacy of Peter and his successors."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-John-Chrysostom.html">St. John Chrysostom</a>: "We must use every endeavour that the 'Word of God may dwell in us abundantly."</li>
<li>Attacks against the authority of Scripture are many, so we must be prepared with multiple types of defense.</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Greek.html">Greek</a> and <a href="../notes/Hebrew.html">Hebrew</a>: "It is most proper that Professors of Sacred Scripture and theologians should master those tongues in which the sacred Books were originally written; and it would be well that Church students also should cultivate them, more especially those who aspire to academic degrees."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>18: <em>Understand science to refute a scientistic reduction of Scripture, and keep in mind the Holy Spirit's purpose in Scripture is not to penetrate the secrets of nature but to provide what is profitable unto salvation.</em>
<ul>
<li>Understand science to refute <a href="../notes/scientism.html">scientism</a>: "It need not be pointed out how the nature of science, just as it is so admirably adapted to show forth the glory of the Great Creator, provided it be taught as it should be, so if it be perversely imparted to the youthful intelligence, it may prove most fatal in destroying the principles of true philosophy and in the corruption of morality. Hence to the Professor of Sacred Scripture a knowledge of natural science will be of very great assistance in detecting such attacks on the Sacred Books, and in refuting them."</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Augustine.html">St. Augustine</a> on interpreting the literal interpretation of <a href="../notes/Genesis.html">Genesis</a>: "Whatever they can really demonstrate to be true of physical nature, we must show to be capable of reconciliation with our Scriptures; and whatever they assert in their treatises which is contrary to these Scriptures of ours, that is to Catholic faith, we must either prove it as well as we can to be entirely false, or at all events we must, without the smallest hesitation, believe it to be so." (cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~On Genesis.md">De Genesi ad litteram</a></em> i. 21, 41.)
<ul>
<li>Also recall that the Holy Spirit, speaking through the authors of Scripture, "did not seek to penetrate the secrets of nature, but rather described and dealt with things in more or less figurative language, or in terms which were commonly used at the time."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>19: <em>Don't hold ancient commentators to scientific statements that are not relevant to matters of faith, and engage with science in scriptural interpretation while appreciating its uncertainty.</em>
<ul>
<li>We defer to the Fathers when they speak in unison on matters of faith, but also recognize their scientific understanding may be that of their time and follow Thomas: "In those things which do not come under the obligation of faith, the Saints were at liberty to hold divergent opinions, just as we ourselves are." (<em><a href="2021-08-12-Summa-Theologiae.html">Summa Theologiae</a></em> p. I, q. lxx., a. I, ad 3.)</li>
<li>Speak to science, but also appreciate its uncertainty: "The Catholic interpreter, although he should show that those facts of natural science which investigators affirm to be now quite certain are not contrary to the Scripture rightly explained, must nevertheless always bear in mind, that much which has been held and proved as certain has afterwards been called in question and rejected."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inspiration-incompatible-with-error">Inspiration Incompatible with Error</h3>

<ul>
<li>20: <em>Holy Scripture in whole is inspired by God.</em>
<ul>
<li>&gt;"It is absolutely wrong and forbidden, either to narrow inspiration to certain parts only of Holy Scripture, or to admit that the sacred writer has erred. For the system of those who, in order to rid themselves of these difficulties, do not hesitate to concede that divine inspiration regards the things of faith and morals, and nothing beyond, because (as they wrongly think) in a question of the truth or falsehood of a passage, we should consider not so much what God has said as the reason and purpose which He had in mind in saying it-this system cannot be tolerated. For all the books which the Church receives as sacred and canonical, are written wholly and entirely, with all their parts, at the dictation of the Holy Ghost; and so far is it from being possible that any error can co-exist with inspiration, that inspiration not only is essentially incompatible with error, but excludes and rejects it as absolutely and necessarily as it is impossible that God Himself, the supreme Truth, can utter that which is not true. This is the ancient and unchanging faith of the Church, solemnly defined in the Councils of Florence and of Trent, and finally confirmed and more expressly formulated by the Council of the Vatican. These are the words of the last: "The Books of the Old and New Testament, whole and entire, with all their parts, as enumerated in the decree of the same Council (Trent) and in the ancient Latin Vulgate, are to be received as sacred and canonical. And the Church holds them as sacred and canonical, not because, having been composed by human industry, they were afterwards approved by her authority; nor only because they contain revelation without error; but because, having been written under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, they have God for their author." Hence, because the Holy Ghost employed men as His instruments, we cannot therefore say that it was these inspired instruments who, perchance, have fallen into error, and not the primary author. For, by supernatural power, He so moved and impelled them to write-He was so present to them-that the things which He ordered, and those only, they, first, rightly understood, then willed faithfully to write down, and finally expressed in apt words and with infallible truth. Otherwise, it could not be said that He was the Author of the entire Scripture. Such has always been the persuasion of the Fathers. "Therefore," says St. Augustine, "since they wrote the things which He showed and uttered to them, it cannot be pretended that He is not the writer; for His members executed what their Head dictated." And St. Gregory the Great thus pronounces: "Most superfluous it is to inquire who wrote these things-we loyally believe the Holy Ghost to be the Author of the book. He wrote it Who dictated it for writing; He wrote it Who inspired its execution."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>21: <em>We must let a firm belief in the inerrancy of Scripture guide our interpretation.</em>
<ul>
<li>"Those who maintain that an error is possible in any genuine passage of the sacred writings, either pervert the Catholic notion of inspiration, or make God the author of such error."</li>
<li>The Fathers "laboured earnestly, with no less skill than reverence, to reconcile with each other those numerous passages which seem at variance".</li>
<li>"God, speaking by the sacred writers, could not set down anything but what was true."</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Jerome.html">St. Jerome</a>: "I have learned to pay such honour and reverence as to believe most firmly that none of their writers has fallen into any error. And if in these Books I meet anything which seems contrary to truth, I shall not hesitate to conclude either that the text is faulty, or that the translator has not expressed the meaning of the passage, or that I myself do not understand."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>22: <em>We ought to defend the Bible with learning, including through contributions to centers for its study.</em>
<ul>
<li>We should all defend the Holy Bible: "Learned and distinguished men" ought to "select each of them the branch of study most suitable to his circumstances, and endeavour to excel therein, and thus be prepared to repulse with credit and distinction the assaults on the Word of God."</li>
<li>Give to the likes of the St. Paul Center! "It is Our pleasing duty to give deserved praise to a work which certain Catholics have taken up-that is to say, the formation of societies and the contribution of considerable sums of money, for the purpose of supplying studious and learned men with every kind of help and assistance in carrying out complete studies. Truly an excellent fashion of investing money, and well-suited to the times in which we live!"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>23: <em>We should all defend the Scriptures, but also rest in apparent contradictions and not presume to understand more than we do.</em>
<ul>
<li>"Let them loyally hold that God, the Creator and Ruler of all things, is also the Author of the Scriptures - and that therefore nothing can be proved either by physical science or archaeology which can really contradict the Scriptures. If, then, apparent contradiction be met with, every effort should be made to remove it."</li>
<li>Leo cites a <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Deuterocanonical Book</a> not in the Catholic Canon: "Even if the difficulty is after all not cleared up and the discrepancy seems to remain, the contest must not be abandoned; truth cannot contradict truth, and we may be sure that some mistake has been made either in the interpretation of the sacred words, or in the polemical discussion itself; and <strong>if no such mistake can be detected, we must then suspend judgment for the time being</strong>. There have been objections without number perseveringly directed against the Scripture for many a long year, which have been proved to be futile and are now never heard of; and not unfrequently interpretations have been placed on certain passages of Scripture (not belonging to the rule of faith or morals) which have been rectified by more careful investigations. As time goes on, mistaken views die and disappear; but "<strong>truth remaineth and groweth stronger for ever and ever.</strong>" (61. 3 Esdr. iv., 38., cited also in <a href="https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Sent.I.Pr.DivandExp.41">Sent.I.Pr.DivandExp.41</a>: <em>Veritas. 3 Esdr. 4:38: veritas manet, et invalescit in aeternum</em>, He adds that the battle will not cease so long as truth remains firm, Sent. I, prol. 3, quoting Hilary, On the Trinity, bk. 10, ch. 1 (CCSL 62A; PL 10:345). following 1 Esdras 4:38: the truth will endure and prevail into eternity.)</li>
<li>"No one should be so presumptuous as to think that he understands the whole of the Scripture."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>24: <em>Approach Scripture with reverence and piety to advance in virtue and divine love.</em>
<ul>
<li>"Exert yourselves with willing alacrity!"</li>
<li>"We admonish with paternal love all students and ministers of the Church always to approach the Sacred Writings with reverence and piety; for it is impossible to attain to the profitable understanding thereof unless the arrogance of "earthly" science be laid aside, and there be excited in the heart the holy desire for that wisdom "which is from above." In this way the intelligence which is once admitted to these sacred studies, and thereby illuminated and strengthened, will acquire a marvellous facility in detecting and avoiding the fallacies of human science, and in gathering and using for eternal salvation all that is valuable and precious; whilst at the same time the heart will grow warm, and will strive with ardent longing to advance in virtue and in divine love."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>25: <em>Blessing</em>
<ul>
<li>"We lovingly impart in Our Lord the Apostolic Benediction."</li>
</ul></li>
