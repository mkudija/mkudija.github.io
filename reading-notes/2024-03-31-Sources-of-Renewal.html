<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p><em>by Rev. Adam Kubiś</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The primary object of the Council was to bring the Church up to date and point the way to the union of Christians </li>
<li>The title <em>Sources of Renewal</em> itself suggests clearly that the Author regards Vatican II as the cornerstone of the <em>aggiornamento</em>. It is his conviction that the Council is a sign of the times for the Church, relating eternal human problems to the Gospel in their contemporary forms and clarifying them by its light. </li>
<li>This work as a whole is a synthesis of the main points of the teaching of Vatican II. It is a reply to the question: "what does it mean to be a Christian, to live in the Church and in the modern world?"</li>
<li><em>Sources of Renewal</em> was written by Cardinal Wojtyla for the guidance of the Pastoral Synod of the archdiocese of Crakow which was then beginning its work.</li>
<li>Previous Councils were dogmatic and apologetic. Vatican II was primarily pastoral: it sought to give a positive presentation of the faith, above all in its relation to modern man and the modern world. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li>Vatican II has a "unique and unrepeatable meaning for all who took part" </li>
<li>This book is intended as a study of 'initiation'. It is not a commentary on the Council documents. It is an introduction to the documents from the point of view of translating them into the life and faith of the Church.<br />

</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-i-the-need-for-an-enrichment-of-faith">Chapter I: The need for an enrichment of faith</h2>

<ul>
<li>The implementation of Vatican II must be based on the principle of the "enrichment of faith", i.e. increasingly full participation in divine truth (15), an enrichment of the whole existence of the believing member of the Church (18)</li>
<li>Every Council is an act of the supreme magisterium of the Church (16)</li>
<li>The teaching of the magisterium is concerned essentially with questions of faith and morals: what men and women should believe in and in what manner, and hence how they should olive according to their faith (17)</li>
<li>A pastoral Council proclaims, recalls or clarifies truths for the primary purpose of giving Christians a life-style, a way of thinking and acting (18)</li>
<li>This work focuses on the <em>consciousness</em> of Christians and the <em>attitudes</em> they should acquire (18)</li>
