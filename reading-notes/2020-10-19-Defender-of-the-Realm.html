<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h2 id="quotes-about-churchill">Quotes about Churchill</h2>

<ul>
<li>Simple: "Churchill had a natural sympathy for simple people, because he himself took a simple view of what was required; and he hated casuistry. That was no doubt why the man-in-the-street loved him and the intellectuals did not." (Jock Colville, 6)</li>
<li>"Churchill simply did not much care for what other people thought, and cared not at all about how they might <em>feel</em>" (8)</li>
<li>Respect: "Those who vehemently disagreed with him, and stated their case clearly, were those who won his respect." (14)</li>
<li>"He did not live in the past; the past lived on in him." (24)</li>
<li>"The idea that Britain was part of Europe but not 'in' Europe informed Churchill's political beliefs for his entire life." (119, 963)</li>
<li>"He often said that history would be kind to him, because he would write it." (207)</li>
<li>"He had a way of seeing gold where others saw dirt." (341)</li>
<li>"Churchill spent his entire life rehearsing his <em>impromptu</em> remarks" (365)</li>
<li>Maps: "Churchill loved maps, as much for their utility as for their ability to stoke his imagination" (427)</li>
<li>Constructive conflict: "Whereas a peevish Hitler squelched dissent, Churchill fostered an often-fractious give-and-take between himself and his generals, with the result that decisions taken were made stronger by having been annealed in the furnace of debate." (448)</li>
<li>"Neither Alexander nor Ismay 'felt in the least aggrieved' by Churchill's 'deliciously ingenuous lack of consideration' for their personal safety and convenience because 'we knew he would treat himself in exactly the same way—and worse—if he thought it would help the war." (689)</li>
<li>Faith: "Churchill didn't write prayers, and he didn't say prayers." (782-3)</li>
<li>"Churchill venerated tradition, but ridiculed convention" (833)</li>
<li>"For all that I thank God I was given an opportunity of working alongside such a man, and having my eyes opened to the fact that occasionally such supermen exist on this earth." (Brooke, 952)</li>
