<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes

Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos

<p><img src="https://stpaulcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/front-cover.jpg" width=150></p>

<p><code>(Steubenville: Emmaus Road Publishing, 2020), 528</code></p>

<div class="note"> <p><strong>Quick Summary: </strong>The Church is in crisis (as usual), and renewal comes through individual turning away from sin and toward God (as usual).</p></div> 

<div class="note"> <p><strong>Summary: </strong>The Church is experiencing a crisis across many fronts—especially a pervasive attitude of universalism and relativism that minimizes culpability for sin, the backlack from the sexual revolution leading to apostasy as the Church accommodates itself to the world, disordered priorities that deny the Gospel in favor of more attractive secular causes, and pastoral passivity in the face of modernity—all of which has grown recently by what is at best a lack of clarity or at worst a studied ambiguity from Rome. The path forward starts with individual repentance and renewal of our participation in the prophetic mission of Jesus, set aflame by the Holy Spirit.</p></div> 

<p>This book is important, but must be approached with caution. The crisis in the Church is real and must be forcefully confronted, and not used as an excuse to despair or a distraction from the primary solution, which is the pursuit of personal holiness. </p>

<p>Before wading into the crisis I chose to immerse myself in the solution, which is given in his previous book <em><a href="2022-12-30-The-Fulfillment-of-All-Desire.html">The Fulfillment of All Desire</a></em>. This was a fruitful choice and it allowed me to examine the crisis with a firmer foundation and a healthy sense of perspective.</p>

<p>Martin presents many historical and contemporary figures as examples of either infidelity to truth or orthodoxy and courage. One challenge, when reading Martin's criticisms of particular writings of these individuals, is to not interpret them as a blanket criticism or endorsement of their work or an assessment of their personal holiness. I was surprised, for example, to see a number of challenging and critical comments about <a href="../notes/Bishop-Barron.html">Bishop Barron</a> and <a href="../notes/Hans-Urs-von-Balthasar.html">Hans Urs von Balthasar</a>. These should be taken for what they are a points of correction pertaining to a portion of what they have said, and not a dismissal of their entire corpus.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-baby"><a href="#fn-baby">1</a></sup> The same applies in reverse to those he praises. </p>

<p>Pope Francis himself is a central figure in the current crisis, and Martin appears to be both firm and charitable in his assessment of the current pope. He recognizes the many good and orthodox aspects of Francis' teaching, while also clearly challenging his ambiguity: "The objective reality is that he is causing and passively accepting immense confusion and division in the Church and seems strangely reluctant to resolve it" (178).</p>

<p>One benefit (and challenge) of this book is the voluminous collection sources: many books and many articles or blogs going into more depth on details of this crisis. A word of caution here as well: there is not enough time in life to study the <em>good</em> things to start off with, and while it is good to be generally aware of elements of the crisis so as to reverse it, the primary focus should be on living in the truth and growing in holiness. This is how Martin closes, and this is the challenge to take up. As such, I will be referring in the future no so much to this book, but much more to <em><a href="2022-12-30-The-Fulfillment-of-All-Desire.html">The Fulfillment of All Desire</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-a-time-of-confusion-and-division">Chapter 1: A Time of Confusion and Division</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: There is serious confusion in the Church over very important matters of doctrine and morality. Rome is at fault not for directly heretical teaching, but rather for sowing confusion and ambiguity and not offering direct clarification.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Current Confusion</strong></p>

<li>It began with Pope Francis' "Who am I to judge?" comment (23)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-is-there-a-solid-place-to-stand">Chapter 2: Is There a Solid Place to Stand?</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We need to stand firmly on the foundation of of Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium.</em></p>

<p><strong>Scripture</strong> (it all starts here)</p>

<ul>
<li>There are many faithful and vibrant resources on Scripture today: <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Jesus of Nazareth.md">Jesus of Nazareth</a></em>, <em><a href="2023-01-31-Verbum-Domini.html">Verbum Domini</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture New Testament Set.md">Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Inspiration and Interpretation.md">Inspiration and Interpretation</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Encountering the Living God in Scripture.md">Encountering the Living God in Scripture</a></em> (46)</li>
<li>But there are also those who <strong>bracket Scripture</strong> by omitting relevant context or challenging passages (49), justified for "psychological difficulty" (51)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/John-Paul-II.html">John Paul II</a>: we must pass on the faith "whole and entire, in all its rigor and vigor" (56, cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Catechesi Tradendae.md">Catechesi Tradendae</a></em> <a href="../notes/bib.html">bib</a>)</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scripture is a fire, a rock, a power, a lifeline, an urgent warning, a privileged communication, a source of life-saving knowledge, the key to happiness, and a profound love letter! (58)</p>

<ul>
<li>Fr. Francis Martin: the written Word leads us into relationship with the Living Word, Jesus himself (59)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>To interpret scripture, we must trust the Tradition of the Church as well as her Magisterium, given clearly today in the <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Catechism of the Catholic Church.md">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></em> <a href="../notes/bib.html">bib</a>, which is an "authoritative and irreplaceable guide to what the Catholic Church actually believes and teaches."

<li>St. Vincent of Lérins: development is <em>progress</em> (improved in itself), not <em>change</em> (turned from one thing into another)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once we depart from a truly Catholic understanding of the authority and reliability of Scripture and tradition, there is no longer a foundation to stand on, and Christianity has no defense from the cultural pressures of the time that insist that we accommodate ourselves to them. (64)</p>

<h2 id="chapter-3-is-it-all-a-game-the-fog-of-universalism">Chapter 3: Is It All a Game? The Fog of Universalism</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: <strong><a href="../notes/Universalism.html">Universalism</a></strong> is the belief that all or almost all will be saved. This has become the default position in parts of the Church, and is dangerous because it minimizes the importance of faith, repentance, and baptism as necessary for salvation, thereby taking the urgency out of evangelization. It also contradicts the insistent message of Scripture and what Jesus' explicit teaching.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Distressingly, fornication, divorce and remarriage, pornography, and masturbation have become so widely accepted, even among many Catholics, that the real cutting edge of the revolution now is the acceptance of the practice of homosexuality and transgenderism. (109)</p>

<li>Silence from the Church

<li>"A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?" (122, cf. <a href="../notes/Heb-10.html">Heb-10</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The two issues which I think are most under attack today—the issue of salvation and the issue of sexual morality—I think require us to give clear, truthful answers or to become complicit in affirming our culture in their deceptions and wishful thinking in these areas. It is not loving, kind, or merciful to not tell people the full truth that shows them the path to salvation. (132)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The <a href="../notes/German-Catholic-Church.html">German</a> Factor</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The German church is <em>rich</em> because Catholic-registered taxpayers pay 8-9% of their income to the church</li>
<li>The German church is <em>powerful</em> because—due to its riches—it funds churches in many poorer countries, who seek to please their benefactor </li>
<li>The German church is <em>progressive</em> because it is not at risk as are churches that are not state-supported in other developed countries, and because it seeks to be "updated" in the eyes of an increasingly secular populous </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Should Be Done?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>"But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart." (141, cf. <a href="../notes/Mt-05.html">Mt-05</a>)</li>
<li>"Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? You are not your own; you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body." (142 cf <a href="../notes/1-Cor-06.html">1 Cor-06</a>)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Robert-Bellarmine.html">St. Robert Bellarmine</a>: "If they contribute to the glory of God and your eternal happiness, then they are good and should be sought. If they detract from this, they are evil and must be avoided."  (144)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-5-how-long-will-you-straddle-the-issue">Chapter 5: How Long Will You Straddle the Issue?</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: It is problematic to see the Vatican aligning itself with those advancing a new "global humanism" but oppose basic moral teachings of the Church (i.e. Jeffrey Sachs and George Soros) and placing emphasis on "human development" at the expense of preaching the Gospel.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Liberation-Theology.html">Liberation Theology</a> has positive elements (including supporting the poor and responsible care for the earth), but suffers from deficiencies including: (1) dismissal of the importance of the evil of personal sin, (2) silence about the significance of sexual sin, and (3) acceptance of many Marxist categories (148)</li>
<li>The documents from the synod on the Amazon: "I kept asking myself, Can you imagine Jesus saying things like this? No. Jesus was laser focused on the salvation of souls, on faith and repentance, on our eternal destinies." (172)</li>
<li>Even secular atheists are waking up to the dangers of departing from orthodox Christianity: "Without Christianity, we are heading into a thick and impenetrable darkness." (198, cf. <em><a href="https://stream.org/atheists-in-praise-of-christianity/">Atheists in Praise of Christianity?</a></em>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-6-is-anyone-responsible">Chapter 6: Is Anyone Responsible?</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: There are a lot of people in the church today doing gymnastics making arguments that diminish culpability—especially in the realm of sexual morality—and making people at least perceive that it is "less wrong" or "more alright" that they don't adhere to the law (both natural and of the Church). However, he says that rather than seeking to determine culpability, we should focus on calling everyone to a life of repentance and obedience to God..</em></p>

<h2 id="chapter-7-seeing-and-not-seeing">Chapter 7: Seeing and Not Seeing</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We need to stop pretending that things are ok. Non-radical solutions may not be enough to right the ship.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church will find her essence afresh and with full conviction in that which was always at her center: faith in the triune God, in Jesus Christ, the SOn of God made man, in the presence of the Spirit until the end of the world.  (236 cf. <em><a href="2021-07-03-Faith-and-the-Future.html">Faith and the Future</a></em> <a href="../notes/bib.html">bib</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Preparing for the <a href="../notes/coming-persecution.html">coming persecution</a>: "None of us can be sure of what we would do under increased pressure, but unless we are cultivating the deepest relationship with the Lord possible and practicing self-denial, the acceptance of suffering, and courage and boldness in proclaiming and living the truth now, we will not be ready for the infusion of additional grace that will be needed—and given—as the pressures increase."

<h2 id="chapter-9-pastoral-passivity-good-shepherds-and-bad">Chapter 9: Pastoral Passivity: Good Shepherds and Bad</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Pastoral passivity has been one of the main factors contributing to the crisis of truth in the Church. This passivity has come to mean an accommodation or affirmation of sin, which is not fidelity to the truty.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Vatican-II.html">Vatican II</a> created some challenges: interpreted primarily by theologians (not bishops), theologians and journalists often distorted its meaning in a progressive direction, many went "beyond the Council" and were rooted not in the actual texts but in the "spirit of Vatican II", a focus on the <a href="../notes/historical-critical-method.html">historical-critical method</a> and a "hermeneutic of suspicion" leading to speculative theology, a rush to embrace secular causes (302-304)</li>
<li>"Pastoral" has come to mean "permissive" and "accommodating". But authentic Christian  service is based on fidelity to the truth, and giving people what they want does not serve them.</li>
<li>Pluralism in the Church is only legitimate if it involves diverse expressions of the <em>one faith</em>: unity is based on truth</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our main concern for our children as Christian <a href="../notes/Parenting.html">parents</a> is not losing them for a limited time on this earth but losing them for all eternity out of a deluded sentimentality that makes us afraid to speak the truth in love...If we approve of their immoral activity, we are confirming them on their path to hell.

<h2 id="chapter-11-a-time-for-repentance">Chapter 11: A Time for Repentance</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: The appropriate response to the situation of the Church today is turning back to God in repentance so that we may undergo his purification.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>We need to consider not only the evil we have done but also the "good" we have done that was not the will of God. (364)</li>
<li>Those with pastoral responsibility, including parents, will have to give a special accounting: "Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we who teach shall be judged with greater strictness." (374 cf. <a href="../notes/Jas-03.html">Jas-03</a>)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe that it is virtually impossible to be a responsible Christian unless we are making room in our daily lives for prayer and sound spiritual reading, for study of Christian truth, and for contact with others who also want to live fervent Christian lives and serve God faithfully. (381)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter-12-a-time-for-action">Chapter 12: A Time for Action</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We need to be grounded in the truth, intercede for the Church and ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and take action to honor God's Word.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>"A firm and clear grasp of Christian truth must be the basis of our relationship with God." (385)</li>
<li>"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all men generously and without reproaching, and it will be given him." ( 388 cf. <a href="../notes/Jas-01.html">Jas-01</a>)</li>
<li>"The fruitfulness of our life and work depends on the degree to which we have been transformed in Christ": helpful to this is reading the <a href="../notes/Doctors-of-the-Church.html">Doctors of the Church</a>, as well as faithful contemporary Catholic spiritual writers: <a href="../notes/Fr.-Thomas-Dubay.html">Fr.

<li>"The first order of business for today needs to be reform, repentance, and rebuilding the basic fabric of Catholic life." (401)</li>
<li>We need to respond with prayer for the Church and for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, especially through the Rosary (404)

</ul></li>
<li>We need to take action rooted in the principle that we will not stand by as God and his Word are dishonored in our sphere of responsibility and in a way appropriate to the situation (405)</li>

<h2 id="chapter-13-the-inexhaustible-riches-of-jesus-participating-in-the-prophetic-mission-of-jesus">Chapter 13: The Inexhaustible Riches of Jesus: Participating in the Prophetic Mission of Jesus</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We need to focus on imitating Jesus' prophetic zeal and ask for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit to divide truth from falsehood.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus is <em>priest</em>, <em>prophet</em>, and <em>king</em>: this section focuses on Jesus as prophet which was the primary focus of his earthly ministry </li>
<li><strong>Zeal</strong> is the confluence of knowledge and love: for this we need an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and this is the framework for the other virtues to work

</ul></li>
<li>We will suffer either way for the truth: "The pain of disunity is less than the pain of infidelity" (436)</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>There will be division in our hearts, the sword of the Spirit will divide true from false. (436)</p>
