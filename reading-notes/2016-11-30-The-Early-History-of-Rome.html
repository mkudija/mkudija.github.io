<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h1 id="the-early-history-of-rome-by-livy">The Early History of Rome by Livy</h1>

<p>BOOK I - Rome Under the Kings</p>

<ul>
<li>“The study of history is the best medicine for a sick mind; for in history you have a record of the infinite variety of human experience plainly set out for all to see; and in that record you can find for yourself and your country both examples and warnings; fine things to take as models, base things, rotten through and through, to avoid.” (30)</li>
<li>sounds familiar… “Of late years wealth has made us greedy, and self-indulgence has brought us, through every form of sensual excel, to be, if I and so put it, in love with weather both individual and collective.” (30)</li>
<li>starts with Trojans and Latins being joined</li>
<li>Romulus and Remus rescued by wolf, Romulus kills Remus and is the first king who expands with military might (such as stealing women from neighboring cities with a fake festival, drawing troops out of a city and then demolishing them). He was supposedly taken up into the sky by a cloud</li>
<li>Numa Pompilius ruled peacefully, imbued religious devotion</li>
<li>Tullus Hostilius again ruled with force. 3 v 3 brothers in war with Alba; Rome victorious but killed his sister. Defeated the Sabines, then killed by the plague. (69)</li>
<li>Ancus Marcius mixed religion and war, built pile bridge across Tiber, and was a great administrator </li>
<li>Tarquinius Priscus came to Rome and grew in influence, became king by sending Ancus' sons away on hunting expedition, </li>
<li>Servius Tullius was son of refugee and raised in the palace, king attacked with axe and pretended he was still alive while he grabbed power, census with classes, </li>
<li>Tarquinius Superbus (the proud), married Tullia (after they killed their spouses), ousted the king, stood up visiting senators, ruled as a dictator, rape and suicide of Lucretia</li>

<li>Publius Valerius became consul, </li>
<li>Former members of the royal court, argued in favor of a king: law was inflexible and "had no ears", but at least a king was human </li>

<li>Valerius became consul and with Brutus fought Tarquin attack, Brutus died while killing Arruns, Rome won (2.6)</li>
<li>Valerius suspected of monarchical ambitions, but took actions to distance himself and became popular (2.7)</li>
