<p>Questions he seeks to answer: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>What is silence?</em></li>
<li>*Where is it? </li>
<li><em>Why is it more impirtant than ever?</em></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>

<p>“Good poetry reminds me of the great explorers. The right words are able to set my thoughts in motion” (10)</p>

<h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>

<p>“Sometimes it makes more sense to make life more difficult than necessary” (46)</p>

<h1 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h1>

<p>“Boredom can be described as a lack of purpose.” (62)</p>

<h1 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h1>

<p>Heidegger said we would give up our freedom for technology. We would shift from being free people to being resources for others....who is to be master? You or someone else?</p>

<h1 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h1>

<p>Thie chapter is a beautiful reflection on the night sky, especially: “The starry sky ‘is the truest friend in life, when you’ve first become acquainted; it is ever there, it gives ever peace, ever reminds you that your restlessness, your doubt, your pains are passiving trivialities. The universe is and will remain unshaken. Our opinions, our struggles, our sufferings see not so important and unique, when all is said and done.’” - Fridtjof Nansen (83-85) </p>

<h1 id="chapter-31">Chapter 31</h1>

<p>“I’ve started to understand why I was so fascinated as a small boy by the snail who carries his house on his back. We can also carry our houses - everything that we have - within us.” (125)</p>

<p>-—&gt; this reminds me of "The Major Debate" (why should your discipline be used to rebuild the world?) I went to at Notre Dame on 11/8/11. The PLS professor Robert Goulding responded: "Fill your life with those things you can carry with you from a shipwreck."</p>

<h1 id="chapter-32">Chapter 32</h1>

<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->
