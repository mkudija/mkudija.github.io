<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p>Some interesting passages:</p>

<p>PREAMBLE<br />
In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as<br />
our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred,</p>

<p>We, the people of Éire, Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ, Who sustained our fathers through centuries of trial, </p>

<p>Gratefully remembering their heroic and unremitting struggle to regain the rightful independence of our Nation,</p>

<p>And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence,<br />
Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured,<br />
true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established<br />
with other nations,</p>

<p>Do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution</p>

<p>ARTICLE 18<br />
4. The elected members of Seanad Éireann shall be elected as follows:<br />
- Three shall be elected by the National University of Ireland.<br />
- Three shall be elected by the University of Dublin.<br />
- Forty-three shall be elected from panels of candidates constituted as<br />
hereinafter provided.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 41<br />
1.<br />
- The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental<br />
unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and<br />
imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.<br />
- The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution<br />
and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to<br />
the welfare of the Nation and the State.</p>

<p>2.</p>

<ul>
<li>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman<br />
gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be<br />
achieved.</li>
<li>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be<br />
obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their<br />
duties in the home.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of<br />
Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</li>
</ol>

<p>ARTICLE 44<br />
1. The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty<br />
God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.</p>

<ol>
<li>Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are,<br />
subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</li>
</ol>
