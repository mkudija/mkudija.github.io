<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>Give the Lord your firstfruits, especially the firstfruits of your time </li>
<li>"You shall be my people and I shall be your God"</li>
<li>We are always tempted to idolatry (usually making good things ultimate things) </li>
<li>Be faithful to the Lord, always</li>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>Just for fun, the chart below shows my progress in 2022. I started listening to the Bible in a Year podcast late in February (see <a href="#inspiration-for-bible-in-a-year">Inspiration for "Bible in a Year"</a>), so I was already 35 days behind. The straight segments are stretches of not listening, which were especially bad from May to July. I kicked it into high gear in October to finish by the the end of the year. </p>

<p><strong>Day 243</strong>: 2022-10-23-Sun - </p>

<ul>
<li>Jer-48#v10: "Cursed are they who do the LORD's work carelessly"</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Day 262</strong>: 2022-10-29-Sat - </p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus walking on the water: sometimes we are tempted to resent God: the disciples were only in the boat in the storm in the first place because Jesus told them to be there. But Peter walking on the water shows us that when we do God’s will he will help us to do things we would not be able to do otherwise  </li>
<li>Simon, you are rock, and upon this rock I will build my church: in Caesarea Philippi there are huge rock cliffs where this takes place</li>

<h2 id="introduction-to-the-return">Introduction to the Return</h2>

<ul>
<li>Yellow  </li>
<li>This period is the rise of the synagogue and the rise of the class of Pharisees, development of kosher rules  </li>
<li>Three returns from exile: first rebuilds the temple, second Ezra teaches the word of God, third Nehemiah rebuilds the walls  </li>
<li>The temple, word, and walls show us the three things we need to rebuild from disaster: a sacramental life, the Word of God, and the Church   </li>
<li>The prodigal son in Luke is really an icon of the exile and return</li>

<ul>
<li>Cyrus (influenced by the samaritans) halts work on the rebuilding of Jerusalem because of its past rebelliousness  </li>
<li>the people who have seen the old temple weep when they see the lesser new temple, but there’s an element of them being stuck in the past and not able to see what God is doing now  </li>
<li>the temple building is stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius, which is when Haggai and Zechariah are writing  </li>
<li>Zechariah: “I come and will dwell on the midst of you days the lord”  </li>
<li>Zechariah: “I will remove the guilt of this land in a single day”</li>
<li>Zechariah’s vision of Joshua and the accuser: he is not worthy to offer sacrifice but go and sin no more</li>

<ul>
<li>Ezra: the building of the temple is restarted by finding the original records from Cyrus in which he instructs the temple to be rebuilt and paid for: this is bureaucracy at its finest  </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Day 270</strong>: 2022-11-01-Tue - </p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Day 271</strong>: 2022-11-02-Wed - </p>

<ul>
<li>Ezra: the Israelites who had married foreign wives put them and their children away as a means of returning to God. Recall how God warned them against intermarriage when they settled the promised land. “Holy” means separate.  </li>

<li>Zechariah 10: “I am the Lord their God's and I shall answer them”  </li>
<li>Zechariah 10:”I will make them strong in the Lord and they shall glory in his name”  </li>
<li>There are two kinds of shepherds: those that care for their sheep and those who don’t: prophecy of Jesus</li>

<p><strong>Day 272</strong>: 2022-11-02-Wed - </p>

<ul>
<li>Nehemiah (second part of Ezra): “come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem”  </li>

<ul>
<li>Nehemiah: “our God will fight for us”  </li>
<li>Nehemiah's first move when finding opposition to doing God’s work is to pray to God. He trusts fully in God and he also makes good practical decisions  </li>
<li>Nehemiah doesn’t repeat the mistake of Rehaboam (Solomon’s son) who was even harder on the people and caused the kingdom to split, rather he does not oppress the people with taxes as the former governors in his place did  </li>
<li>Esther 11-12 are the first two books of the narrative, but Jerome placed them at the end because he didn’t regard them as canonical. He was obedient to Pope Dismas and the tradition of the New Testament writers who 80% of the time referenced the Greek Septuagint which included those chapters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Day 275</strong>: 2022-11-02-Wed - </p>

<ul>
<li>Nehemiah 6: plots against Nehemiah: “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down”; don’t let people stop us from doing God’s will, in whatever talk he has given us!  </li>
<li>Esther is brought into this broken system so that God can do something great</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Day 276</strong>: 2022-11-02-Wed - </p>

<ul>
<li>The King's letter in Esther 13 about the Jews almost sounds like it could be written by a repressive government about Christians today </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Day 277</strong>: 2022-11-03-Thu - </p>

<ul>
<li>Nehemiah: Ezra retells the story of Israel. When things go wrong the first place we should look is in ourselves. God please hear our prayer not because we are good, but because you are faithful.  </li>
<li>Est-11: Mordechai’s prayer is beautiful, humble, asks for God’s will, worships God, and then makes a request  </li>
<li>Esther’s prayer (Est-14): we have to remember that we are only stewards of our lives and everything may be asked of us at any time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Day 278</strong>: 2022-11-03-Thu - </p>

<ul>
<li>Esther was terrified, but God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness  </li>
<li>God allows Esther the weakness that will bring about his will; God wants to work with our weakness</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Day 279</strong>: 2022-11-04-Fri - </p>

<li>Sirach 1-3 is awesome!  </li>
<li>Sir-01: “the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom”  </li>

<li>"For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries.

<h2 id="inspiration-for-bible-in-a-year">Inspiration for "Bible in a Year"</h2>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://holyfamilycolumbus.org/documents/third-sunday-in-ordinary-time">2022-01-23 Holy Family Bulletin</a></p>

<p><em>The Bible in a year podcast was mentioned at the end of this article in the bulletin, and I loved the story of the priest who had been reading the Bible every year for 24 years.</em></p>

<p>Since the beginning of his pontificate, Pope Francis has given particular attention to how Catholics celebrate the Mass. The Mass is not only, as the Vatican II|Second Vatican Council clearly taught, the “source and summit of the Christian life,” but also a school. Because the faith of believers is profoundly influenced by the way the Church prays (<em>lex orandi, lex credendi</em>), Pope Francis has sought in various ways to strengthen the liturgical curriculum.  </p>

<p>He has buttressed the Marian piety of the Mass, establishing the memorial of Mary, Mother of the Church, on the day after Pentecost and extending the memorial of Our Lady of Loreto to the universal Church. He has bolstered devotion to St. Joseph as the guardian of the Church by requiring his intercession to be invoked in every Eucharistic Prayer. He has underlined the necessary connection between liturgy and charity in establishing in 2017 the World Day of the Poor on the 33rd Sunday of Ordinary Time.  </p>

<p>On January 26, 2020 the Church celebrated for the first time an important new annual feast, the Sunday of the Word of God, which Pope Francis established to accentuate the importance that Sacred Scripture is meant to have in the faith, prayer and lives of believers.  </p>

<p>He announced it intentionally September 2019, on the feast of St. Jerome, the famous translator of the Bible from the Greek and Hebrew into Latin, then the common language of the people. In 2020 the Church marked the 1,600th anniversary of St. Jerome’s death. He is famous for emphasizing, <strong>“Ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ”</strong> - that unless we are familiar with what Jesus said and did in the Gospel, how He fulfilled all the prophecies of the Old Testament, and how the apostles proclaimed Him, we really do not know Him.  </p>

<p>St. Jerome learned this lesson the hard way. As a brilliant young student traveling to study from the great masters of his day, he got deathly ill with something that took the life of his companions. He had been up until this point a lukewarm Christian, far more passionate about Greco-Roman literature than the faith. </p>

<p>During his sickness he had a dream in which he was appearing before the judgment seat of Christ. When he professed he was a Christian, Jesus replied that he was, rather, a Ciceronian, because he knew far more about Cicero and his writings than he did about Christ and His teachings. It struck Jerome to the core. He didn’t know Christ because he didn’t know the Scriptures! After he awoke and recovered, he resolved to pour his mind, heart and time into the study and diffusion of the Word of God. Pope Francis is hoping that St. Jerome’s example of converted zeal will be contagious.  </p>

<p>In his decree establishing the feast, <em>Aperuit Illis</em>, taken from the words in the Emmaus scene describing how Jesus “opened to them what referred to Him in all the Scriptures” (Luke 24:27), Pope Francis said he hopes that this feast will help believers “grow in religious and intimate familiarity with the Sacred Scriptures,” “appreciate the inexhaustible riches contained in that constant dialogue between the Lord and His people,” “experience anew how the risen Lord opens up for us the treasury of His Word and enables us to proclaim its unfathomable riches before the world,” and “marked by this decisive relationship with the living Word ..., grow in love and faithful<br />
witness.”  </p>

<p>Desiring the feast to be dedicated to the “celebration, study and dissemination of the Word of God,” he made various practical suggestions. He asked that the Sacred Scriptures be “enthroned” during Mass, to focus on the permanent, normative value of God’s Word. He suggested that the installation of lectors or commissioning of readers take place, showing the importance of proclaiming God’s Word and giving extra attention to readers’ formation to proclaim it faithfully and beautifully. He asked priests in a particular way to focus on their preaching, so that the Word of God may be better understood and come more alive in the heads of hearts of believers. He encouraged training in <em>lectio divina</em> (prayerful reading of Scripture), so that people may prayerfully assimilate the content of Scripture. And he expressed hope that since the Third Sunday of Ordinary Time either will each year fall within or at the end of the Octave of Prayer for Christian Unity, the Sunday of the Word of God might bear great ecumenical fruit, “since the Scriptures point out, for those who listen, the path to authentic and firm unity.” I would like to underline two points.  </p>

<p>The first is about celebrating the word of God as the great treasure it is. During the 2008 Synod on the Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church, Bishop Antons Justs of Jelgava, Latvia, gave an unforgettable intervention (talk). He described a priest, <strong>Father Viktors, who was arrested by the Soviets for possessing the Bible and commanded him to step on it. Instead, he knelt and kissed it, for which he was condemned to 10 years of hard labor in Siberia</strong>. When he returned a decade later as an emaciated witness to Scripture’s inestimable value, he celebrated Mass with his people. After proclaiming the Gospel, he kissed once more the Word of God, and he and the people cried profusely with gratitude to God.</p>

<p>Father Viktors wasn’t alone in his testimony, “In Latvia, during the Soviet era,” Bishop Justs continued, “no religious books, no Holy Scriptures, no catechisms were allowed to be printed. The reasoning was: If there is no printed Word of God, there will be no religion. So our Latvian people did what the first-century Christians did: They learnt the passages of the Holy Scriptures by heart.” (cf. Memorize Scripture, <em>2021-10-30-Live Not By Lies|Live Not By Lies</em>)</p>

<p>And specifically with regard to celebration, he recounted, “Still today in Latvia there is an oral tradition alive. We stand on the shoulders of our martyrs to proclaim the Word of God. Our grandchildren remember their grandfathers and grandmothers, who died for their faith; they want to be in their turn, heroes of faith. In Latvia, we proclaim the living Word of God! We go in the processions and on the pilgrimages; we sing songs, and we pray and say: ‘This is the Word of God, for which our grandparents died.”’  </p>

<p>A people learning Sacred Scripture by heart, taking the Bible on pilgrimages, proudly proclaiming the Word of God, and seeking to be heroes in witness to it—this is what the Catholic Church is meant to be. This is the type of faith and celebration Pope Francis, by establishing this feast, is trying to catalyze.  </p>

<p><strong>The second point is about learning Sacred Scripture. About a decade ago, I happened to meet a priest from Cleveland at Green Airport in Providence, Rhode Island. I invited him to lunch. When the cashier asked if there would be one check or two, I said one and gave my credit card. Father Bob immediately interjected, “Sirach says we should go Dutch!” I stared at him quizzically, but retorted, “Jesus calls us to love one another as He loves us and the Last Supper wasn’t Dutch. I’m paying!”</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>When we got to the table, immediately after grace, I asked whether he had invented the quotation from Sirach. “Not at all,” he enthusiastically replied, as he pulled a worn Bible from his backpack and amazingly opened it to the exact page in the Book of Sirach where it says not to be ashamed to “share the expenses of a business or journey” (Sir-42#v3).</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Blown away, and frankly filled with holy envy by his command of Scripture, I asked how he had come to know the Word of God so well. He told me he had made a promise the day of his diaconal ordination to read the entire Bible once a year and that he had been faithful to that promise. “After 24 years,” he said with a smile, “you get to know what Sirach says about restaurant bills!”</strong>  </p>

<p>I asked him how long it takes to read the whole Bible in a year. He replied that it takes cumulatively only 75 hours, or 12—15 minutes a day.  </p>

<p>Since that encounter, I’ve tried to emulate Father Bob’s commitment to reading the Bible each year and have encouraged many others to join us. Twelve to 15 minutes a day can change your life. There are so many books and smartphone applications that make reading the Bible in a year easier, intelligently varying the passages to help one understand it better than if one just read from cover to cover. I’d encourage you to consult them.  </p>

<p>If ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ, intimate familiarity with the Word of God will help you to know not only the inspired words, but the Word made flesh so much better.  </p>
