<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<li>He said that for quite some time now he had been having the feeling that <em>God wanted him to sacrifice his life for the salvation of his peoples</em>. Completely taken aback, the Empress was unable to say a word in reply. The Emperor said nothing and seemed to be waiting. Then, as his eyes again looked at the Church of Our Lady on the mountain, he concluded with great resolution, "<em>And I shall do so!</em>" (15)</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Sunday, the 26th of March, a Mass was held in the salon next to the sickroom; the door was half-opened between the two rooms. He was pleased to learn from Father Zsambóki that since he was ill he was permitted to take communion, even though he was taking fluids during the night. But since he had eaten a biscuit at 2 o'clock in the morning, he refrained from requesting Holy Communion, despite the fact that he had gone without the Holy Sacrament in the previous few days. This was because he was primarily concerned he might commit a profane act because of his incessant cough. The Empress communicated this on behalf of the Emperor to the priest before the start of Mass. Remarkably, however, the Emperor's cough completely ceased during the Holy Sacrifice. Initially, Emperor Karl had arranged for the doors to the adjoining room only to be left ajar so he would not be seen, but could still listen to the Mass. Later he allowed the door to be left open wide, saying, "I so much wish to see the altar!"</p>
  
  <p>After the priest had taken communion, the ill patient turned to the Empress during the Confiteor, asking "Who will receive communion?" _ "Countess Mensdorff." - "I should also like to receive communion." - "But that's impossible, there is only one host." - "Please hurry and say I must receive communion!" The Empress got up, and as she went to the door she saw the priest take out a second host from the ciborium after giving communion to Countess Mensdorff and look over to her, questioningly.</p>
  
  <p>The Empress nodded her agreement, and the Emperor received the Body of Christ. After Mass, the Emperor expressed the wish for the Gospel of the "Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes" to be read to him again.</p>
  
  <p>Empress Zita thought that the Emperor had completely forgotten the biscuit he had consumed during the night, but the Emperor brought up the matter in the afternoon, saying, "There was something quite odd about receiving Holy Communion today. As I listened to the Confiteor, it was as if our savior was standing next to me saying: 'You must receive Holy Communion.' And although I did not immediately understand what was meant and had my reservations, it was as if He repeated himself: 'Hurry, you must receive communion this very moment!' or 'I want you to have communion now. There is no longer anything to hinder you!' At that moment I could think of nothing else, not even of my having eaten something during the night. That is why I asked you to hurry."</p>

<ul>
<li>"Have Otto come here. He Should see everything just as it is. He should know how one ought to behave in such situations - as a Catholic and as an Emperor!" (28-30)</li>
<li>"Emperor Karl did not even confide in his wife how much he was suffering...He suffered in silence, without uttering any complaints at all." (33)</li>
<li>"It is good that there is trust in the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Otherwise all this would be impossible to bear." (35)</li>
<li>"Complain? Grumble" If one knows the Will of God, all is well. All of my efforts are always aimed at recognizing and following the Will of God in all things as clearly as possible, and as perfectly as possible. There must be no grumbling." (38)</li>
<li>"I have to suffer so much for my people to come together again." (44)</li>
<li>Prayer of <a href="../notes/Parenting.html">parents</a>: "Dear Lord, protect our children, (N). Protect them body and soul; let them die rather than commit a mortal sin. Amen! Thy will be done. Amen!" (45)</li>
<li>"Jesus, I live for you, Jesus, I die for you, dear Jesus, come!" (45-46)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>About half an hour before the end he opened his eyes, looked first at the Blessed Sacrament, then at Father Zsambóki, and begged to receive Holy Communion. The Empress asked him whether he really wanted to receive Holy Communion. He nodded and said, "Yes!" She thought she had not understood him correctly and asked a second time, "Do you really wish to receive Holy Communion again?" The Emperor turned to her and said with the greatest of longing, "Oh, I do, I long for it so terribly!" Who could resist such a request? Father Zsambóki decided to give the Emperor the Body of Christ once more as sustenance for his journey. The face of the dying man, which just a few moments previously had been serious and tired, became radiant with joy when he received the sacrament. This radiance was to remain with him up to the moment of his death. (46)</p>
