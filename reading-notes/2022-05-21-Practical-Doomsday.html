<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p>This is a well thought out and common-sense approach to emergency planning. The author's information security background makes him especially qualified to write a book like this which continually evaluates threats and defenses through the lens of risk, reward, and cost.

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<ul>
<li>The author grew up in Communist Poland, almost ended up on the street after losing a job, etc: disasters aren't rare today</li>
<li>"Prepping shouldn't be about expecting the apocalypse; it should be about enjoying life to the fullest without having to worry about what's in the news."</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="part-i-thinking-about-risk">Part I: Thinking about Risk</h1>

<h2 id="chapter-1-a-method-to-the-madness">Chapter 1: A Method to the Madness</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Simplify your thinking and rank order outcomes to prepare for using a simple framework that accounts for frequency, severity, and cost of mitigation.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Think about risk as a trade-off between safety, liberty, and utility</li>
<li>Focus on <em>outcomes</em> (in a financially precarious spot), not <em>causes of events</em> (stories of how you got there): you will always need to put food on the table and pay the bills</li>
<li>Look at your daily routing and stress-test external dependencies</li>
<li>Quantify risk as <em>impact</em> vs <em>probability</em> vs <em>minimum cost</em> of mitigating a concern (in time, effort, and money)
<ul>
<li>$\text{Risk Rank} \propto \frac{\text{Probability of Event} \times \text{Potential Impact}}{\text{Min non-recoverable mitigation cost}}$</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simplify your thinking</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Films-to-Watch.html">Films to Watch</a>: <em>One Child Nation</em>, 2019 documentary about <a href="../notes/China.html">China</a></li>
<li><em>The Bet</em> by Paul Sabin <a href="../notes/bib.html">bib</a>: case study in how easy it is to mistake possibility for certainty</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-the-specter-of-humdrum-calamities">Chapter 2: The Specter of Humdrum Calamities</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Many ordinary events can set us back: loss of job, car accidents, fires, etc.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Unemployment: consider the impact of lifestyle creep</li>
<li>Loss of shelter: Have necessities (clothing, cash, documents, computer backup) stored at a secure location not far from home</li>
<li>Unintentional injury: focus on prevention in everyday habits</li>
<li>Theft: situational awareness and de-escalation skills </li>
<li>Illness and Death: set up your finances for ease of transition to survivors</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-3-exploring-large-scale-risks">Chapter 3: Exploring Large-Scale Risks</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: He reviews a number of cyclical regional disasters ranging from natural disasters to economic downturns. A preparedness plan for many of these requires either the ability shelter in place for a time or evacuate quickly to a safer location.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperinflation is regular: https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/hyper</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-4-oh-no-zombies">Chapter 4: Oh No, Zombies</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: He reviews the risks of a number of much more severe and unlikely scenarios but stresses the key of flexibility and building a financial safety net and robust social network.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>None of the apocalyptic predictions that have animated the masses throughout the ages has ever come to pass.</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Scientism.html">Scientism</a>: "Just like religion, science isn't immune to being twisted in the service of decidedly unscientific causes and beliefs." (30)</li>
<li>Liberties, once surrendered, are almost never willingly given back (37)</li>
<li>"I'm cautiously optimistic about the future of humanity, but I don't have faith in our ability to remember the lessons of history as the accounts are rewritten and retold, and as the visceral atrocities of bygone days are gradually abstracted away and reduced to a sentence or two. In this sense, my greatest fear is that we won't make enough small blunders to keep reminding ourselves of what's right and what's wrong, eventually leading to us repeating some of our greatest mistakes on a much grander scale." (39)</li>
<li><em><a href="https://archive.org/details/NuclearWarSurvivalSkills_201405/">Nuclear War Survival Skills</a></em> and <em><a href="2022-05-21-Raven-Rock.html">Raven Rock</a></em> <a href="../notes/bib.html">bib</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="part-ii-the-prepared-lifestyle">Part II: The Prepared Lifestyle</h1>

<h2 id="chapter-5-mind-over-matter">Chapter 5: Mind Over Matter</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Focus on planning and simple lifestyle changes first before buying gear or supplies.</em></p>

<h2 id="chapter-6-building-a-rainy-day-fund">Chapter 6: Building a Rainy-Day Fund</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Money helps with everyday hurdles as much as disasters, and can help bring the clarity needed to walk away from all kinds of non-financial harm.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund_b_9065308">A Story of a Fuck off Fund</a> by Paulette Perhach <a href="../notes/bib.html">bib</a></li>
<li>Make every transaction count: think of money as a claim check on society awarded for your contributions to the well-being of others and redeemable toward the pursuit of your own life goals</li>
<li>Rainy day fund initial goal: 3 months of post-tax earnings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-7-safeguarding-your-savings">Chapter 7: Safeguarding Your Savings</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: A brief history of money and monetary policy and some tips for building a Doomsday portfolio.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Debt, not coinage, was the original money; money is simply an accounting tool</li>
<li>Why is the government in the business of making money? (cf. <em>What Has Government Done to Our Money?</em> by <a href="../notes/Murray-Rothbard.html">Murray Rothbard</a> and <em><a href="2022-01-05-The-Ethics-of-Money-Production.html">The Ethics of Money Production</a></em>)</li>
<li>He is not a fan of cryptocurrencies (but treats "crypto" as a class without a focus on <a href="../notes/Bitcoin.html">Bitcoin</a>)</li>
<li>"Financial systems are emergent and chaotic phenomena, not a sinister scheme devised to take from the poor and give to the rich." (74)</li>
<li>Goal of a doomsday portfolio is that no single event can wipe out the bulk of your savings.</li>
<li>Portfolio:
<ul>
<li>Hold several weeks of physical cash, which also lets you opt out of surveillance</li>
<li>Split your money between financial institutions with different risk portfolios.</li>
<li>Loans amount to taking a short position against your local currency (as do holding an alternate currency).</li>
<li>Mostly avoid bonds; invest in 10-20 value equities (i.e. <em><a href="2016-01-09-The-Intelligent-Investor.html">The Intelligent Investor</a></em> <a href="../notes/bib.html">bib</a>) rather than index funds, but only up to 50% of portfolio (80)</li>
<li>Use 1% for stock options and commodities futures options as an insurance policy</li>
<li>Some precious metals (which are liquid, private and compact, but risk physical loss and unlikely to bootstrap a gold-based economy)</li>
<li>Real estate (potentially rural plot of land with a cabin)</li>
<li>Historical collectibles</li>
<li>Avoid crypto and NFTs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-8-engineering-a-doomsday-proof-career">Chapter 8: Engineering a Doomsday-Proof Career</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: To minimize the chances of dying, focus on yourself and consider the risk vs reward.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Practice defensive driving</li>
<li>Take extra caution when working at heights</li>
<li>Avoid poisoning: use ibuprofen rather than acetaminophen (99-100)</li>
<li>Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs</li>
<li>Practice workshop safety (cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Workshop Wound Care.md">Workshop Wound Care</a></em>)
<ul>
<li>Table saws and angle grinders are especially dangerous</li>
<li>Use push sticks and sleds</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fireproof the homestead: be tidy, have fire extinguishers, prepare escape routes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-10-protecting-oneself-in-the-digital-and-physical-realm">Chapter 10: Protecting Oneself in the Digital and Physical Realm</h2>
