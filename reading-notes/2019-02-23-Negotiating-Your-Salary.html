<p>Just remember: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Poorly executed negotiations are thousands of dollars more valuable than no negotiations at all"</em> (178)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="salary-negotiation-rules">Salary Negotiation Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Rule 1: Postpone Salary Talk Until There&#8217;s an Offer</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reason 1: you might be screened out too early</li>
<li>reason 2: they may use that info to make you a lowball offer</li>
<li>reason 3: as people&#8217;s desire for something grows, so does their flexibility and how much they can afford</li>
<li>reason 4: you can get info during the interview about how much they need you and what it will cost them if they don&#8217;t have you</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rule 2: Let Them Go First, Unless&#8230;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rule 3: Repeat the number at the top of the range and be quiet</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Objectively Researched Value (ORV): market</li>
<li>Individual Value (IV): subjective assessment</li>
<li>Risk Factor (RF): compensation contingent on future success</li>
<li>Benefits and perks</li>
<li>&#8211;> OVR determines a range, and IV places you in that range</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rule 4: Reply with your ideal based on your research</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rule 5: Benefits and Perks</strong></p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-million-dollar-blunders">Chapter 1 - Million Dollar Blunders</h2>

<ul>
<li>establish a <em>virtuous cycle</em> of career development: negotiate top salary, perform great, earn bonuses, get attention, repeat&#8230;</li>
<li>the principle of <em>quality</em>: quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-aiming-for-what-youre-worth">Chapter 2 - Aiming for What You&#8217;re Worth</h2>

<ul>
<li>What employer&#8217;s think about:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>labor is intangible: there is no fixed price, but always a range</li><br />
<li>salary relates to level of responsibility</li><br />
<li>&#8220;universal hiring principle": <em>make me a buck</em></li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-3-rule-1-when-to-discuss-money">Chapter 3 - Rule 1: When to Discuss Money</h2>

<ul>
<li>budget bending: people make it work for things they really want</li>
<li>employers ask for your previous salary to screen you</li>
<li>Ways to postpone&#8230;:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m sure you have something budgeted for the position. What range did you have in mind?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we can come to a good salary agreement if I&#8217;m the right person.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Are you offering me the role?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m paid very fairly for my responsibilities in my present role, and I would expect a fair salary with respect to my responsibilities here. Let&#8217;s keep talking to see if I&#8217;m the best fit for the role.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Hell, it don&#8217;t make no diff&#8217;rence what I was a-making&#8217; b&#8217;fore. It&#8217;s what <em>you&#8217;re</em> gonna pay me that counts, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve noticed by now that it&#8217;s a clear principle of mine never to discuss salary up front. If we&#8217;re going to work together, we&#8217;ll have to respect each other&#8217;s principles, won&#8217;t we? So let&#8217;s see how I can help you make or save money.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to answer that do I?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;All I expect is a fair and competative offer with respect to this role.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we can come to a good salary agreement when the time comes.&#8221; </li><br />
<li>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about salary; I know I need to make you more than I cost. Let&#8217;s make sure the fit is right.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Look, if salary if all you&#8217;re worried about, there&#8217;s no problem! When I&#8217;ve hired people myself, salary has been just the finishing touch to the person who can really play for the team. Let&#8217;s talk about it when we&#8217;re sure I&#8217;m the player you&#8217;re after.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to appear difficult. I can understand that you want to make sure you can afford me, and I won&#8217;t require a salary out of line with the job. But it is a principle of mine not to discuss salary yet, because it can throw us off track. What&#8217;s really important is whether I&#8217;m right for the job and what I can produce for you.&#8221; </li><br />
<li>&#8220;Well, compensation is about number three on my priorities list right now. Number one is making sure we can work together, and I&#8217;d just as soon concentrate on that for now, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to say anything at this point that might scare you away, and I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t want to say something that might discourage me, so if it&#8217;s okay with you, I&#8217;d like to just keep an open mind on the subject for now.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Me mention a figure first? I have absolutely no upper limits. Now what did you have in mind?&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>If they get angry with you for dodging the question:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;May I ask a question? Are you wondering if you can afford me or is there another consideration?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to talk in more detail about this when the time comes, but can you help me understand why we need to discuss that now?&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Preemptive Strike: &#8220;By the way, I know it&#8217;s too early to discuss compenstaion in detail, but I wonder if you can give me a rough idea of the range you were thinking for this position?&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-4-rule-2-let-them-go-first">Chapter 4 - Rule 2: Let Them Go First</h2>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;who speaks first has the most to lose&#8221;</li>
<li>let them go first unless:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>you are confident starting high won&#8217;t jeopardize the offer</li><br />
<li>you&#8217;re certain you won&#8217;t start off too low, and </li><br />
<li>you are positive they&#8217;re at the offer-making stage</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>speaking first to &#8220;anchor&#8221; can result in a higher outcome for you, but this is the higher risk option</li>
<li>have your <strong>ISN</strong> numbers ready:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Ideal: the most you could hope for and then some</li><br />
<li>Satisfactory: what&#8217;s the going rate for someone as good as me?</li><br />
<li>No-go: below this is a deal breaker</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>If you go first:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>start with your ideal number, qualifying it by saying it is a target and not a demand</li><br />
<li>include your rationale/research</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-5-rule-3-your-first-response">Chapter 5 - Rule 3: Your First Response</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Repeat the figure at the top of the range and then be quiet.</em><br />
<ul><br />
<li>Let a look of concern cross your face.</li><br />
<li>Count to thirty&#8230;</li><br />
<li>Compare the offer with your research (ISN numbers)</li><br />
<li>Let the interviewer be nervous, worried, or anxious</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Your silence, then their response, then you respond with the truth:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Sounds great</li><br />
<li>Sounds acceptable</li><br />
<li>Sounds dissapointing</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>They go first:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Them: &#8220;Our offer is $ABC&#8221;</li><br />
<li>You: &#8220;$ABC?&#8221; [hmmm; silence]</li><br />
<li>Them: &#8220;We are flexible, what did you have in mind?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>You: &#8220;May I share my IDEAL with you? Let&#8217;s hold it as a target, not a demand. Here it is&#8230;&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>You go first:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>You: &#8220;May I share my IDEAL with you? Let&#8217;s hold it as a target, not a demand. Here it is&#8230;&#8221;</li><br />
<li>Them: &#8220;Gasp! Well, we were thinking of offering $XYZ.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>You: &#8220;$XYZ?&#8221; [hmmm; silence]</li><br />
<li>Them: &#8220;Would you accept $DEF?&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>if you go into a negotitaion with a fuzzy no-go value, you risk waffling and talking yourself into a lower offer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-6-rule-4-your-researched-response">Chapter 6 - Rule 4: Your Researched Response</h2>

<ul>
<li>People think they will lose respect if they talk too much about money. That&#8217;s true before an offer is made, but after the offer is made it can actually increase respect.</li>
<li>If their offer is <em>very high</em>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>double check to make sure you aren&#8217;t in over your head</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>If their offer is <em>low, but not below your no-go</em>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;$XXX. I appreciate your offer.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;And I would love to work here.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sure you want to pay me a compensation that is fair and will keep me committed and producive, isn&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Well, from my research I estimate that positions like this for someone with my qualifications are paying between x and y. What can you do in that range?&#8221; (your range should be the high end of your research, so if you researched $75-80k, you say $80-85k)</li><br />
<li>If they can&#8217;t go higher, let them sweat a little: &#8220;I&#8217;m still very excited about the opportunity but need some time to think it over. Can we touch base tomorrow or Friday?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>or, &#8220;Considering my xyz, I believe I&#8217;m worth $XYZ. What can you do in that area?&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>If their offer is <em>too low, below your no-go</em>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;Well, we seem far apart at the moment. I don&#8217;t want to decline the offer because I sitll think the fit is good. Is this a firm offer?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Ok, let&#8217;s talk again soon [within 24 hrs]. I&#8217;ll make you a promise: I&#8217;ll consider the compensation to see if I can accept it; meanwhile you can take some time to see if there&#8217;s anything we&#8217;ve overloked to make it better.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Then, if I can accept that offer, I&#8217;ll say yes, and I&#8217;ll mean yes. If I can&#8217;t feel right about the deal, I&#8217;ll say no, and suggest you look for another candidate who will fill the bill for you at that price.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;How does that sound?&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>If their offer is <em>just right</em>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Unlikely it is just right, since the first offer you hear is commonly their lowest</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Your figure matches my research exactly. I think that&#8217;s a perfect starting point.&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Since I expect to learn fast, work hard, and become very productive for you, I&#8217;d like to discuss scheduling a tentative raise to X in six months.&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-7-rule-5-benefits-and-perks">Chapter 7 - Rule 5: Benefits and Perks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Salary reviews:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Auto cost of living increases: &#8220;I expect that my salary will keep pace with inflation, so there will be a cost-of-living adjustment each year, won&#8217;t there?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>Six-month review</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Sales compensation</li>
<li>Performance bonuses: &#8220;Let&#8217;s consider setting up a special bonus to encourage excellent performance. Can you think of a workable one?&#8221;</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Cars and expense accounts</li>
<li>Professional memberships</li>
<li>Vacation and personal days</li>
<li>Relocation expenses</li>
<li>Signing bonus</li>
<li>Time to think it over:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;This sounds terrific! I think we&#8217;ve really got a solid match here. Would you jot this all down so we&#8217;re clear? And I&#8217;ll get back to you <em>as soon as you need to know</em>. When do you need to know?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Yes! We&#8217;re done! I can&#8217;t wait to get started. I will need to look this over to make sure we haven&#8217;t forgotten anything, so when do you want my final confirmation?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m giving my tentative yes right now and I&#8217;ll give you the permanent one as soon as you need to hear it. When would that be?&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;Ok, I don&#8217;t see anything left to talk about right now. I&#8217;ll sleep on this, look at it again to make sure we haven&#8217;t missed anything, and confirm it in writing by that date.&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Two or more offers:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Try to extend: &#8220;This meets all my criteria for what I want and I have every indication that this is the correct match, but I want to consider this very carefully. I&#8217;d like two weeks to let this decision settle. Will that work with your schedule?&#8221;</li><br />
<li>Accelerate the other offer: &#8220;I have another offer. The job is not better or worse, just different. Frankly, my preference is to take the one in which I can make the best contribution. How can we get things moving here to meet the deadline of the first offer?&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Counter-offers<br />
<ul><br />
<li>consider a counter offer from your current employer just as you would two offers you have on the table and rank them against each other in the various categories</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Urgent employers<br />
<ul><br />
<li>feel it out, and leave some wiggle room: &#8220;I accept! There may be a detail or two in the compensation package we&#8217;ve overlooked, so if I think of anything I&#8217;ll let you know in the next couple of days.&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>When to get it in writing:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;let&#8217;s jot it down": always</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-8-special-situations">Chapter 8 - Special Situations</h2>

<ul>
<li>When discussing salary expectations outside job interviews, focus on a researched level of responsibility and the associated pay.</li>
<li>With recruiters, avoid if possible and if not stress your researched expectations not your current salary and give a wide range.</li>
<li>how to deal with salary on job applications</li>
<li>never inflate your current salary:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>integrity</li><br />
<li>they will sense it and can find a way to verify</li><br />
<li>good recruiters won&#8217;t let past salary get in the way of evaluating what your salary should be</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>negotiate in person or schedule a call so both are fully present</li>
<li>never negotiate by email</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-9-evaluating-and-negotiating-a-stock-options-package">Chapter 9 - Evaluating and Negotiating a Stock Options Package</h2>

<h2 id="chapter-10-raises-and-salary-reviews">Chapter 10 - Raises and Salary Reviews</h2>

<ul>
<li>employers don&#8217;t give raises, employees earn them</li>
<li>communicate:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>document your results</li><br />
<li>get your boss to acknowledge them</li><br />
<li>negotiate a raise the same way you&#8217;d negotiate a salary</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>&#8220;the wheel that squeaks the loudest gets the grease": don&#8217;t assume your boss knows what a good job you&#8217;ve done keeping things running smoothly</li>
<li>keep a job journal of:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>your achievements (quantifiable)</li><br />
<li>the talents of your superiors, colleagues, subordinates, customers (know what your boss values so you can measure your results in language they will understand and appreciate)</li><br />
<li>your ideas for progress</li><br />
<li>news items about your industry/career</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>use your journal to prepare a 1-page memo, which you deliver to your boss</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-11-you-go-first-perspective">Chapter 11 - You Go First Perspective</h2>

<ul>
<li>you share first if salary talk won&#8217;t screen you out and you think it will help the employer think bigger</li>
<li>&#8220;Poorly executed negotiations are thousands of dollars more valuable than no negotiations at all&#8221; (178)</li>
<li>Giving into their request for salary info:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><em>Lease effective</em>: cave and tell them, but if you do this at least focus on <em>expectations</em> rather than <em>history</em> and use your well-researched range</li><br />
<li><em>Moderately effective</em>: just discuss market value</li><br />
<li><em>Better still</em>: &#8220;My salary expectations? They&#8217;re simple: a fair market value. Perhaps you can help me there: what&#8217;s the range you&#8217;re thinking of?&#8221;</li><br />
<li><em>Best</em>: &#8220;Perhaps we can postpone salary discussions until we&#8217;re sure this is a good fit?&#8221;</li><br />
</ul></li>
