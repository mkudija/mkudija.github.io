<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<li>"There is a story told about Rudolf I, the first Habsburg ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. One day in about the 1260s (more or less when Thomas Aquinas lived), Count Rudolf of Habsburg went hunting in his forests in Switzerland. He came to a river where a priest was bringing viaticum (the Blessed Sacrament) to a dying man. The river was too swollen for the cleric to cross it. So Rudolf dismounted his horse and allowed the priest to use it to cross the river. When he reached the other side, the priest wanted to give the horse back to Rudolf. But the Count of Habsburg reportedly said these famous words: 'Far be it from me that I shall ever ride Lon a horse that has carried my Lord and Savior. Keep the horse!'" (50)</li>
<li>Charles V's pragmatic response to <a href="../notes/Martin-Luther.html">Martin Luther</a>: "he pointed out that it was more probable that a German monk was wrong than that for more than one thousand years Church teachers had been." (52)</li>
<li>Ferdinand II was the main champion on the Counter-Reformation in Europe: "Non-Catholics think me unfeeling for banning heresy. But I love them rather than I hate them. If I didn't love them, I would freely leave them in their error." (58)</li>

<li><a href="../notes/Subsidiarity.html">Subsidiarity</a> is the key principle for understanding the Holy Roman Empire and the Austo-Hungarian monarchy: issues should be addressed by the lowest institutional level that is competent to resolve them (79), for two reasons: <em>efficiency</em>, and <em>accountability</em> (80)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="rule-6-be-brave-in-battle-or-have-a-great-general">Rule 6: Be Brave in Battle (or Have a Great General)</h2>

<ul>
<li>"The next time you are in <a href="2025-07-Vienna-Trip.html">Vienna</a>, walk to the <em>Heldenplatz</em> and contemplate the famous equestrian statue of Charles in the middle of battle." (129)</li>
