<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><code>(San Francisco: Ignatius, 2000/2018), 271</code></p>

<p>Fr. Dailey recommended this to me and I was reintroduced to it when finishing the <em>History of the Catholic Church</em>. Reading Ratzinger is always a special experience—he blends together all of scripture and salvation history into a beautiful narrative, and every word drips with a lifetime of thought behind it. This is a book to think about (before mass certainly) and come back to.</p>

<ul><br />
<li>liturgy gives an all-embracing rule of law and life</li><br />
<li>worship, law, and ethics are inseparable</li><br />

</ul></li>
<li>only when our relationship with God is right can our relationships with others be right (35)</li>

<ul>
<li>Israel's liturgy is special because:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>directed toward God</li><br />
<li>Old and New are bound together especially through liturgy: (Christ as first-born points to Exodus passover)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>real worship is the self-offering of the Son (58)</li>
<li>"The Eucharist is the meeting point of all the lines that lead from the Old Covenant, indeed, from the whole of man's religious history. Here at last is right worship, ever longed for and yet surpassing our powers: adoration in 'spirit and truth'" (61)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part-ii-time-and-space-in-the-liturgy">Part II: Time and Space in the Liturgy</h2>

</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-2-sacred-placesthe-significance-of-the-church-building">Chapter 2 - Sacred Places—The Significance of the Church Building</h3>

<ul>
<li>the empty Holy of Holies had already been an expression of hope (80)</li>
<li>Ratzinger cites <em>Liturgy and Architecture</em> by Louis Bouyer (ND Press)</li>
<li>Christians look toward the east: the cosmos speaks of Christ (and we should pray toward the east) (82)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="part-iii-art-and-liturgy">Part III: Art and Liturgy</h2>

<h3 id="chapter-1-the-question-of-images">Chapter 1 - The Question of Images</h3>

<ul>
<li>All sacred images are in a certain sense images of the Resurrection, history read in the light of the Resurrection" (132)</li>
<li>"The image of the shepherd thus sums up the whole of salvation history: God's entry into history, the Incarnation, the pursuit of the lost sheep, and the homeward path into the Church of the Jews and Gentiles." (133)</li>
<li>an icon requires a "fast from the eyes" and a new way of seeing; icons come from and lead to prayer (135)</li>

<li>sacred art finds its subjects in the images of salvation history</li><br />
<li>images display the inner unity of God's action</li><br />

</ul>

<h2 id="part-iv-liturgical-form">Part IV: Liturgical Form</h2>

<h3 id="chapter-1-rite">Chapter 1 - Rite</h3>

<ul>
<li>"rite": the practical arrangements made by the community, in tame and space, for the basic type of worship received from God in faith (174)</li>
<li>individual rites have a relationship to the places where Christianity originated and the apostles preached (177)</li>
<li>rites are forms of apostolic tradition (178)</li>
<li>"With the radicalization of the historical-critical method, it has become very clear today that the <em>sola scriptura</em> principle cannot provide a foundation for the Church and the commonality of her faith." (181)</li>
<li>focus on tradition over creativity (182-183)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-2-the-body-and-the-liturgy">Chapter 2 - The Body and the Liturgy</h3>

<p><strong>Active Participation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>oratio</em> originally means not prayer but public speech (186)</li>
<li>God himself acts and does what is essential</li>
<li>there is only one action: looking together toward the Lord and going out to meet him (188)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Sign of the Cross</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the sign of the cross is a visible and public Yes to God, a confession of faith (191)</li>
<li>Plato: a cross inscribed upon the cosmos (194)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Parental-blessing-of-children.html">Parental blessing of children</a> (198) <a href="../notes/Parenting.html">Parenting</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I shall never forget the devotion and heartfelt care with which my father and mother made the sign of the Cross on the forehead, mouth, and breast of us children when we went away from home, especially when the parting was a long one. This blessing was like an escort that we knew would guide us on our way. It made visible the prayer of our parents, which went with us, and it gave us the assurance that this prayer was supported by the blessing of the Savior. The blessing was also a challenge to us not to go outside the sphere of this blessing. Blessing is a priestly gesture, and so in this sign of the Cross we felt the priesthood of parents, its special dignity and power. I believe that this blessing, which is a perfect expression of the common priesthood of the baptized, should come back in a much stronger way into our daily life and permeate it with the power of the love that comes from the Lord. ^b59826</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Posture</strong><br />
1. Kneeling (<em>prostratio</em>)<br />
- kneeling is characteristically Christian (199)<br />
- the bodily gesture itself is the bearer of the spiritual meaning (204)<br />
- the Christian liturgy is a cosmic liturgy precisely because it bends the knee before the crucified and exalted Lord (207)</p>

<ol>
<li>Standing and Sitting—Liturgy and Culture</li>
<li>kneeling lowers oneself, standing is toward the one who faces him, and sitting by looking into himself (211)</li>
<li>dancing is not a form of expression for the Christian liturgy (212)</li>
<li>"Wherever applause breaks out in the liturgy because of some human achievement, it is a sure sign that the essence of liturgy has totally disappeared and been replaced by a kind of religious entertainment." (212)</li>
<li>"Liturgy can only attract people when it loks, not at itself, but at God, when it allows him to enter and act." (213)</li>
<li><p>popular piety works together with liturgy (216)</p></li>
<li><p>Gestures</p></li>
<li><p>The Human Voice</p></li>
<li><p>in silence we touch the eternal (226)</p></li>
<li><p>Vestments</p></li>
<li><p>as "tent" (232)</p></li>
<li><p>Matter</p></li>
<li>"in the interplay of culture and history, history has priority. God has acted in history and, through history, given the gifts of the earth their significance" (238)</li>
</ol>

<p><code>(San Francisco: Ignatius, 1918/2018), 98</code></p>

<p>I'm glad they included the original that Ratzinger's more recent book was based off in this commemorative edition from Ignatius press. I was on the fence about whether to read it but am glad I did. The weight and beauty of tradition just pours forth from this little volume and makes you see the liturgy in a new light.</p>

<h2 id="the-prayer-of-the-liturgy">The Prayer of the Liturgy</h2>

<ul>
<li>the prayer of a corporate body must be sustained by thought and interwoven with dogma (280)</li>
<li>the liturgy is the "treasure-house of the thought of revelation" (280)</li>
<li>the heart must be guided, supported, and purified by the mind (280)</li>
<li>the liturgy is our teacher that condenses into prayer the entire body of religious truth (283)</li>
<li>Divine Office: model of all devotional practice (289)</li>
<li>on the pursuit of leisure and erudition for the purpose of prayer (289 footnote)</li>
<li>learning and culture is needed to keep a healthy spiritual life (294)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-fellowship-of-the-liturgy">The Fellowship of the Liturgy</h2>

<ul>
<li>the individual is made aware of unity in the liturgy (298), but requires humility (300)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-style-of-the-liturgy">The Style of the Liturgy</h2>

<ul>
<li>genius: "immeasurably original and yet is still universally applicable to human life" (305)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-symbolism-of-the-liturgy">The Symbolism of the Liturgy</h2>

<ul>
<li>symbol: when that which is interior and spiritual finds expression in that which is exterior and material (320)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-playfulness-of-the-liturgy">The Playfulness of the Liturgy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Playfulness as purposelessness (327); something with no purpose has meaning (328)</li>
<li>the liturgy is an end in itself, existing not for us but for God (331)</li>
<li>we must learn to waste time for the sake of God (337)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-seriousness-of-the-liturgy">The Seriousness of the Liturgy</h2>

<ul>
<li>both power and beauty can corrupt the liturgy if the sole focus (341)</li>
<li>truth is the soul of beauty (345), and those who aspire to beauty must first aspire to truth and good (347)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-primacy-of-the-logos-over-the-ethos">The Primacy of the Logos Over the Ethos</h2>

<ul>
<li>the liturgy is primarily occupied in forming the fundamental Christian temper (353)</li>
<li>any attempt to base the truth of a dogma merely on its practical value is essentially un-Catholic (359)</li>
<li>the basis of all genuine and healthy life is a contemplative one (362)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New words</strong></p>
