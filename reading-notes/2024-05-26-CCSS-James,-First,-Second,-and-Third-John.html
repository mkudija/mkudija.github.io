<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes

Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h2 id="a-hrefnotesjameshtmljamesa"><a href="../notes/James.html">James</a></h2>

<p><strong>Introduction to James</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Brilliance of James is in his understanding of faith, the human person, and salvation. Change of behavior begins with a change of heart (1)</li>
<li>James's holiness according to Hegesippus: "He was in the habit of entering alone into the temple, and was frequently found upon his knees begging forgiveness for the people, so that his knees became hard like those of a camel, in consequence of his constantly bending them in his worship of God, and asking forgiveness for the people." (4)</li>
<li>Theological themes: 
<ul>
<li>The strict relationship between faith and works: faith must be accompanied by conduct that manifests the new life in Christ (esp. <a href="../notes/Jas-02.html">Jas-02</a>-26, responding to misinterpretation of Paul's important teaching that Christians are justified by faith rather than works (<a href="../notes/Rom-03.html">Rom-03</a>)</li>
<li>Care for the poor and control the tongue </li>
<li>Take an attitude of humility before God </li>
<li>There is not middle road: waffling and indecision amount to choosing against God. Faith requires a total commitment to the ways of God ,and one's charitable actions demonstrate one's faith.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"James insists on spiritual perfection for <em>all</em> his listeners and shows that the way to get there is a deep conversion that flows from humility and repentance." (11)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="trials-and-joy-james-12-11">Trials and Joy (James 1:2-11)</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-01.html">Jas-01</a>-3 on <a href="../notes/Suffering.html">Suffering</a>: 
<ul>
<li>Trials can lead to human perfection and strengthen our faith </li>
<li>The fruit of trial is a cause of joy</li>
<li>Peter (<a href="../notes/1-Pt-01.html">1 Pt-01</a>-7) and Paul (<a href="../notes/Rom-05.html">Rom-05</a>-4) teach the same thing </li>
<li>James teaches us to see every aspect of life as part of God's mysterious plan of love</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-01.html">Jas-01</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Wisdom.html">Wisdom</a> supplies the divine perspective that enables a person to withstand tirals without giving up and leads to spiritual maturity </li>
<li>Wisdom is obtained only through prayer </li>
</ul></li>
<li>James always has an eye on the next life and teaches us to determine the value of things on the basis of their potential to bring us to eternal life (26)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gods-desire-for-our-life-james-112-27">God's Desire for Our Life (James 1:12-27)</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-01.html">Jas-01</a>
<ul>
<li>If we yield to sin, the final outcome is death. The two options are either:
<ul>
<li>Temptation → perseverance → life </li>
<li>Temptation → sin → death </li>
</ul></li>
<li>The decision to persevere is a decision to love God. A person who continues to trust in God and obey him even when it becomes hard to do so ultimately has chosen to love God.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-01.html">Jas-01</a>: A degenerate lifestyle blocks the transformative power of the word of truth, cf. <em><a href="2023-09-25-The-Way-of-the-Disciple.html">2023-09-25-The Way of the Disciple</a></em></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-01.html">Jas-01</a>: "bias for action" is <a href="../notes/secular-culture-discovering-truths-of-the-faith.html">secular culture discovering truths of the faith</a></li>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Veritas Splendor.md">~Veritas Splendor</a></em></li>
<li>"Life comes through accepting the word of truth and persevering in it; death comes from being ensnared by one's own desires and the influence of the world. For James, life begins with knowing the truth." (39)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="faith-and-love-james-21-13">Faith and Love (James 2:1-13)</h4>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="2013-12-02-Evangelii-Gaudium.html">Evangelii Gaudium</a></em> echoes James by placing the care for the poor at the heart of the Christian life (41)</li>
<li>The poor are chosen by God (2:5-7) and the sin of partiality is tantamount to breaking the whole law (2:8-13)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-02.html">Jas-02</a>: "poor in the world" remain pure by refusing to compromise themselves for the perks that the world offers (46)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-04.html">Jas-04</a>: those who love the world are at enmity with God; there is no middle road (47)</li>
<li>"A person who seeks to become ingratiated with the rich renounces his or her standing as one of God's poor who have a privileged share in his kingdom." (48)</li>
<li>"According to the Pope, at the heart of an inordinate desire for money is a misunderstanding of one's identity. Since Jesus our king has identified with the poor, we must do the same." (49, cf. <em><a href="2019-12-23-Centesimus-Annus.html">Centesimus Annus</a></em> 36)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-02.html">Jas-02</a>: "James directs his readers away from focusing on the gravity of a particular sin to focus instead on the lawgiver, God, thus offering reason not to sin at all: love and respect for God. The law is an indivisible whole that is wither accepted and obeyed or disregarded and disobeyed. God, who is one and indivisible, gave the whole law." (52, cf <em><a href="2023-01-21-A-Church-In-Crisis.html">2023-01-21-A Church In Crisis</a></em>)</li>
<li>"The fact that all of us have sinned greatly and will be judged ought to spur us on to seize opportunities to speak and to act with gracious kindness and generous compassion so that mercy will win out over judgment in our lives." (54)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="faith-without-works-james-214-26">Faith without Works (James 2:14-26)</h4>

<ul>
<li>"A person who has the kind of faith that does not issue in works of mercy has not been transformed by the love of God." (57)</li>
<li>"The Old Testament teaches that care for the poor is the basic feature of life in covenant relationship with God." (57)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-02.html">Jas-02</a>: "Correct belief about God, which the demons share, is not sufficient for salvation. Faith in God must be lived out by obedience to God's commands." (59, cf. <a href="../notes/Mt-07.html">Mt-07</a>)</li>
<li>"We ought to respect other Christians, who may possess less of the truth but may be more faithful at practicing the truth that they know." (60)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-destructive-power-of-the-tongue-james-31-18">The Destructive Power of the Tongue (James 3:1-18)</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-03.html">Jas-03</a>: "The sages (authors of Proverbs, Sirach, Wisdom) were able to impart wisdom because they were imbued with the word of God. They had meditated deeply on it, and it has become part of their very being. A teacher of the faith must first listen to Jesus' words and be formed by them.  A Christian teacher must live and act as Jesus did." (68)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-03.html">Jas-03</a>: "The tongue, because it is propelled by evil, has the capacity to defile one's whole being as well as the entire course of one's existence." (71)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-03.html">Jas-03</a>: 
<ul>
<li>"To curse one who is a son or daughter of God is akin to cursing God himself." (72)</li>
<li>"Like Sirach, James understands that one's speech is a measure of one's interior life." (73, cf. <a href="../notes/Sir-27.html">Sir-27</a>-6)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-John-Chrysostom.html">St. John Chrysostom</a>: "Let not the tongue that has touched the Lord's Body utter anything offensive." (74)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-03.html">Jas-03</a>: 
<ul>
<li>"To be pure means to be wholly and completely aligned with God, seeking to imitate him and live according to his commandments and laws." (77)</li>
<li>"The truly wise person is not necessarily the great scholar, but someone whose life is marked by humility, peace, and mercy." (78)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lover-of-the-world-or-lover-of-god-james-41-10">Lover of the World or Lover of God (James 4:1-10)</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-04.html">Jas-04</a> 
<ul>
<li>Pray and ask! "Prayer means seeking God's will rather than our own." (81)</li>
<li>"Those who indulge their passions have no peace; they live in turmoil within themselves and with hostility toward others." (80)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-04.html">Jas-04</a> 
<ul>
<li>"Loving things more than we love Christ harms our relationship with God...A person can love either God or the world but not both." (82)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-04.html">Jas-04</a> 
<ul>
<li>"The prerequisite for our healing is that we humble ourselves before God in order to receive his grace." (84)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exhortations-against-pride-james-411-56">Exhortations against Pride (James 4:11-5:6)</h4>

<ul>
<li>James warns us to avoid three kinds of behavior that demonstrate arrogance toward God: speaking evil of a brother or sister, attending to  one's business as if God did not exist, and the enjoyment of wealth gained by injustice (89)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-04.html">Jas-04</a>: by judging one usurps the place of God; no one has the right to disregard the divine law and judge a brother or sister (91)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-04.html">Jas-04</a>: docility in recognizing that all depends on God and letting God guide one's future expresses trust in God's will (93)</li>
<li>"With wealth comes a certain status in society and independence that undermine awareness of one's dependence on God." (98)</li>
<li>"A modest lifestyle, almsgiving, and charitable works are fundamental to Christian living." (101)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="patient-perseverance-james-57-11">Patient Perseverance (James 5:7-11)</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-05.html">Jas-05</a>: "Instead of leading us to complain about our brothers or sisters in the faith, hardships ought to increase our longing for redemption." (105)</li>
<li>"The doctrine of the communion of saints teaches us that we are never alone, but we belong to a great body of believers, both past and present, who advance the kingdom of God by overcoming hatred with prayer, love, and sacrifice. If we live our own trials well, perhaps generations to come will be able to look to us for hope and inspiration in their times of difficulty." (108)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="final-instructions-james-512-20">Final Instructions (James 5:12-20)</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-05.html">Jas-05</a>: <a href="../notes/Tertullian.html">Tertullian</a>: "Prayer is the one thing that can conquer God." (118)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Jas-05.html">Jas-05</a>: "The greatest spiritual work of mercy a Christian can do is to being someone back to the right path." (120)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>"God not only forgives our sins but also cleanses us. We are not just pardoned; we are also purified...He is not surprised by our sin; he knows us perfectly. By his grace he helps us to recognize our sin." (149)</li>
<li>"The psalms provide a language for us to confess our sins, and we can make these powerful lines our own." (150, cf. <a href="../notes/Ps-51.html">Ps-51</a>)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/1-Jn-01.html">1 Jn-01</a> is worth <a href="../notes/Memorize-Scripture.html">memorizing</a> for ourselves and to give pastoral encouragement</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/1-Jn-02.html">1 Jn-02</a>: Jesus as the "atoning sacrifice" (NRSV, NIV) captures the sense of both "expiation" (NABRE, NJB, RSV) and "propitiation" (KVJ, ESV) (152)</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="antichrist-and-denial-of-the-truth">Antichrist and Denial of the Truth</h4>

<ul>

For Augustine, love is the key that opens the door to a true understanding of the Bible (210)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Augustine.html">Augustine</a>: "If nothing at all were said in the other pages of the scriptures, and this were the one and only thing that we heard from the voice of the Spirit of God, that <em>God is love</em>, we wouldn't have to look for anything else." (211)</li>
