<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul><br />

</ul></li>
<li>"Blessed are the poor in spirit" (<a href="../notes/Mt-05.html">Mt-05</a>) does not mean "Blessed are the meek, the sissies": this was <a href="../notes/Nietzsche.html">Nietzsche</a>'s "profound misunderstanding of Christianity that led him to his profound hatred of it" (28)</li>

<h2 id="chapter-6-the-social-moral-and-sexual-effects-of-symbolic-logic">Chapter 6: The Social, Moral, and Sexual Effects of Symbolic Logic</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: The new symbolic logic with is reductivism and inclination toward utilitarianism is one of the causes of the culture of death.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Socratic/Aristotelean Logic</strong>: abstract logic dealing with universals</li>
<li>The new <strong>Symbolic Logic</strong> ("propositional logic"): efficient mathematical/scientific logic, or "a set of symbols and rules for manipulating them without needing to know their meaning and content or their relationship to the real world" (58), akin to <a href="../notes/Machine-Learning.html">Machine Learning</a></li>
<li><a href="../notes/David-Hume.html">David Hume</a> inherited from <a href="../notes/John-Locke.html">John Locke</a> the belief that the object of human knowledge is our own ideas and drew the conclusion of <em>skepticism</em>: no certain knowledge of the real world or universal truths</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Kant.html">Kant</a>'s "epistemological idealism" that human reason's job is to <em>form</em> or <em>construct</em> its object</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Aristotle.html">Aristotle</a> believed in epistemological realism where intelligence knows reality and metaphysical realism where reality is intelligible<br />
<ul><br />
<li>the opposite of this is <a href="../notes/Nominalism.html">Nominalism</a>, the belief that universals are only <em>names</em> from <a href="../notes/Ockham.html">Ockham</a></li><br />
<li><a href="../notes/G.K.-Chesterton.html">G.K. Chesterton</a> in <em><a href="2014-10-06-Orthodoxy.html">Orthodoxy</a></em> (238) against <a href="../notes/Nominalism.html">Nominalism</a>: "If [as the moninalist says] all chairs were quite different you could not call them 'all chairs'" </li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>The new logic is like "Newspeak" in <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~1984.md">1984</a></em> in how it shrinks language: "If we cease to say a thing, we soon cease to think it, for there will be no holding-places in our language for the thought. Language is the house of thought, and homelessness is a life-threatening for thoughts as it is for people." (59)</li>
<li>Symbolic logic is "if...then..." and leads to <a href="../notes/Utilitarianism.html">Utilitarianism</a>, whereas Aristotelian logic fosters natural law ethics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-7-twelve-core-values">Chapter 7: Twelve Core Values</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: He reflects on core values and the centrality of becoming a saint.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus Christ is the unity of all values: he is either everything to your or nothing at all (cf. <em><a href="2013-04-03-Mere-Christianity.html">Mere Christianity</a></em>)</li>
<li>Léon Bloy: "There is only one tragedy, in the end: not to have been a saint." (70)</li>

<li>3-R principle of morality: Right Response to Reality (74)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-8-traditionalism-and-progressivism">Chapter 8: Traditionalism and Progressivism (★)</h2>

<p>_<strong>Summary</strong>: Traditionalism and Progressivism are both heresies. What we need instead is faithfulness.</p>

<ul>
<li>Traditionalism and Progressivism are opposite pairs who hold a God in time, not eternity</li>
<li>"God's mission for His Church is to march into the future armed with the wisdom of the past. Secular movements sometimes do this, too, but Christianity is different because our foundation is not the past but the eternal truth God revealed and incarnated in the past, and our goal is not merely a better world in the future but a world beyond time, a world beyond the world." (85)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Darwin.html">Darwin</a>, <a href="../notes/Marx.html">Marx</a>, and <a href="../notes/Freud.html">Freud</a> are the three most influential modern thinkers: all atheists, materialists, naturalists, and immoralists<br />
<ul><br />
<li>The key to understanding <a href="../notes/Marxism.html">Marxism</a> is <a href="../notes/Nietzsche.html">Nietzsche</a>'s <a href="../notes/Will-to-Power.html">Will to Power</a></li><br />
<li><a href="../notes/Freud.html">Freud</a> is a hedonist</li><br />
<li><a href="../notes/Darwin.html">Darwin</a> denies the eternal soul and reducing us to the material causes out of which we evolved<br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>"universal evolutionism is not science at all but ideology and philosophy and even theology in disguise. It is reductionism: We are merely our material cause, with no first efficient cause, no Creator; and no formal cause, no Designer of our identity; and no final cause, no natural ends or purposes to human nature." (88)</li><br /><br />
</ul></li><br />
<li><a href="../notes/Scientism.html">Scientism</a> is self-contradictory since there is not possible proof by science itself of the assumption that science is the only road to certainty</li><br />
<li><a href="../notes/Francis-Bacon.html">Francis Bacon</a> prophesied technology's conquest of nature; see also <a href="../notes/C.-S.-Lewis.html">C. S. Lewis</a>: !<a href="2022-01-01-The-Abolition-of-Man.html">2022-01-01-The Abolition of Man</a></li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>"<em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Brave New World.md">Brave New World</a></em> is a miraculously prophetic book: no one who cares about our culture's future can afford not to read it" (89)</li>
<li><em>Humanae Vitae</em> was prophetic as seeing contraception as only the first of the consequences of abandoning the idea of natural law and natural ends and leaving only the <a href="../notes/Will-to-Power.html">Will to Power</a> and the demand for pleasure...in this world of moral relativism nothing but sentiment constrains action</li>
<li>Our response to this needs to be:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>preservation of monastic islands of sanity (cf. <em><a href="2017-03-17-The-Benedict-Option.html">The Benedict Option</a></em>, and with <a href="../notes/St.-Thomas-More.html">St. Thomas More</a> as our example: <em><a href="2010-06-02-A-Man-For-All-Seasons.html">A Man For All Seasons</a></em>)</li><br />
<li>"You can ignore or refute any argument in words, but you can't ignore or refute that argument in deeds." (93)</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Lewis and Tolkien show us what we need to fight the culture wars.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>"<em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Lord of the Rings.md">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> is us. Its story is our story, its battle is our battle, its world is our world, and its protagonists and antagonists are ours, too." (97)</li>
<li>"<a href="../notes/Myth.html">Myth</a> is more, not less, than allegory in its applicability, for a myth is universal, applicable to many situations, while an allegory is applicable to just one." (99)</li>
<li><em><a href="2022-01-01-The-Abolition-of-Man.html">The Abolition of Man</a></em> (one of the most important books of the last few centuries) teaches us that we are at war for human nature itself. "Man is God's image, and someone's image cannot long remain in a mirror after he himself disappears" (101)</li>

<li>Modern psychologists and sociologists are determinists who don't believe in free will as a result of seeking causal scientific explanations</li>
<li>"The first step to becoming a hero yourself is revering heroism in others."</li>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Lord of the Rings.md">~The Lord of the Rings</a></em> is "the greatest book of the twentieth century"</li>

<ul><br />
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Augustine.html">St. Augustine</a> called this <em>liberum arbitrium</em> (free choice) and <em>libertas</em> (liberty)</li><br />
<li>This is reflected in <a href="../notes/Abraham-Lincoln.html">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s <a href="../notes/Gettysburg-Address.html">Gettysburg Address</a></li><br />

<li>America has faced three great enemies of liberty: Communism, slavery, and <a href="../notes/Abortion.html">Abortion</a> which deny to their victims property, liberty, and life</li>

  <p>The believer should read the great atheists: Voltaire and Nietzsche and Sartre and Russell and Camus and Beckett. And the unbeliever should read the great theists: Augustine and Aquinas and Pascal and Dostoyevsky and Kierkegaard and C.S. Lewis- and let's not forget Jesus. The believer should pray: "God, if you are not what I think you are, please do not let me persist in my illusion, because I want above all to know the truth. I don't want to believe in Santa Claus even though that belief made me more happy and more moral every Christmas. I am tough-minded. I can take it." And he should pray that often. And the unbeliever should pray: "God, if you are really there, please correct me and convince me, because I want above all to know the truth. If you are real and you love me, don't let me miss you." And he should pray that often.<br />

<li>The <a href="../notes/Fact–value-distinction.html">Fact–value distinction</a> is the justification for moral relativism: if values and facts are <em>not</em> absolutely distinct, if values are a special kind of facts, then moral values can be objectively real and there can be a natural moral law</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Aristotle.html">Aristotle</a> and <a href="../notes/St.-Thomas-Aquinas.html">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> see judgments about <em>ends</em>. <a href="../notes/Kant.html">Kant</a> sees them about <em>duties</em>.
