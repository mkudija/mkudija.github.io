<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>Those that win in the new economy are:
<ul>
<li>High Skilled workers - those that play well with complicated machines</li>
<li>Superstars - those who are at the very top of what they do </li>
<li>Owners - those with access to capital</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Core abilities to thrive:
<ul>
<li>Ability to quickly master hard things</li>
<li>Ability to produce at an elite level in terms of quality and speed </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learning hard things takes deliberate practice 
<ul>
<li>Attention focused on the skill to develop</li>
<li>Receive feedback to keep attention on the most productive work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are three ways to find meaning in deep work:
<ul>
<li>Neurological - “management of attention is the most important thing for living a good life"
<ul>
<li>—&gt; choose carefully and then give rapt attention: live a focused life</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Psychological - deep work generates flow, and we are happier when we are immersed in something challenging</li>
<li>Philosophical - citing All Things Shining (and it’s observation that the enlightenment removed the sacredness from work), we need to refocus on the craftsmanship and sacredness of our work
<ul>
<li>the meaning uncovered is due to skill and appreciation of your work, not the outcome (the code is not noble, but the shaping can be)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rule 1 - Work Deeply
<ul>
<li>eudaimonia (Greek concept of the state where you achieve your full potential): eudaimonia machine is a conceptual building with 5 rooms, the last of which provides a protected place for deep work</li>
<li>you have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it —&gt; need to add routines and rituals to minimize the amount of willpower we need to deploy</li>
<li>Decide on your Deep Work Philosophy</li>
<li>1) Monastic Philosophy - maximize depth by eliminating or radically minimizing shallowness
<ul>
<li>single, well-defined goal as measure of success</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2) Bimodal Philosophy - divide your time into regular work, and dedicated (monastic-like) stretches of deep work</li>
<li>3) Rhythmic Philosophy - chain method (do it every day, make it a routine)
<ul>
<li>Define a time for your work and stick to it every day</li>
<li>Early wake up time to go your work for 1-2 hours before your real job </li>
</ul></li>
<li>4) Journalistic Philosophy - get away for any small bit you are able</li>
<li>Ritualize - where, how work, how support work (food/coffee) </li>
<li>Make grand gestures - like Rowling renting hotel room to finish Harry Potter, a special setting can help put you in the right frame of mind; for me, old building or great library</li>
<li>Don’t work alone - hub and spoke model: access to both collaboration and isolation is important</li>
<li>Execute like a business - 4 Disciplines of Execution from Clayton Christensen
<ul>
<li>1) Focus on what is wildly important - say yes to only the most important things</li>
<li>2) Act on the lead measures - lead, not lag: hours of deep work</li>
<li>3) Keep a compelling scoreboard - index card to track your hours of deep work</li>
<li>4) Create a cadence of accountability - regular meetings to assess progress</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be Lazy
<ul>
<li>1) Downtime aids insights - allow your unconscious brain to mull</li>
<li>2) Downtime helps recharge for deep work - go for a walk, and when you disconnect from work you need to fully disconnect</li>
<li>3) The work that evening downtime replaces is not important  - 
<ul>
<li>develop a “shutdown ritual” - review all your tasks at end of day, plan the next day, then shut down</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rule 2 - Embrace Boredom
<ul>
<li>2 goals
<ul>
<li>improve ability to concentrate deeply</li>
<li>overcome desire for distraction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take breaks from focus rather than distraction
<ul>
<li>schedule when you use the internet, then avoid it completely when not in those times</li>
<li>1) This works even if your job needs lots of internet/email
<ul>
<li>amount of use doesn’t matter as much as discipline in avoiding when not supposed to</li>
<li>5 minutes for email/internet every 15 minutes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2) You must keep non-internet blocks completely free regardless of how you schedule
<ul>
<li>if you get stuck, either
<ul>
<li>a) switch to another offline activity</li>
<li>b) re-schedule internet block or now and adjust remaining schedule accordingly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>3) Schedule internet use at home as well
<ul>
<li>waiting and being bored is increasingly rare and increasingly valuable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work like Teddy Roosevelt
<ul>
<li>Estimate time required, shorten the allowed duration, and work with high intensity to meet the objective</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Productive meditation - use physical/non-mental time (walk, run, etc.) to think about a work problem
<ul>
<li>1) Be wary of distractions/looping</li>
<li>2) Structure your deep thinking
<ul>
<li>a) define relevant variables of your problem</li>
<li>b) define the next-step question to answer with those variables</li>
<li>c) review the answer for future use</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Memorize a deck of cards
<ul>
<li>a side effect of memorizing is your ability to concentrate</li>
<li>a) walk through 5 room and remember 10 objects in each room</li>
<li>b) associate a memorable person/think with all types of cards</li>
<li>c) remember each person in each room to memorize a deck</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rule 3 - Quit Social Media
<ul>
<li>need to evaluate both the benefits and the costs when choosing which tools to include in our lives</li>
<li>The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.</li>
<li>Apply the Law of the Vital Few to your Internet Habits
<ul>
<li>a) Identify the main goals in your personal/professional life</li>
<li>b) List the 2-3 most important activities to achieve that goal</li>
<li>c) If a tool contributes to these, only then should you use it</li>
<li>The Law of the Vital Few: 80-20 rule</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quit Social Media
<ul>
<li>ban yourself for 30 days - if still useful after that ban then reintroduce; otherwise delete</li>
<li>social media removes the connection between hard work producing content and people paying attention to you: I’ll pay attention to you if you pay attention to me even if neither of us really adds any value</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself
<ul>
<li>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day: see the time before/after work as a “day within a day"</li>
<li>put some thought into structuring your leisure time to give yourself a quality alternative to distraction during your leisure time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rule 4 - Drain the Shallows
<ul>
<li>Schedule Every Minute of Your Day
<ul>
<li>http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/</li>
</ul></li>
<li>goal it not to stick to plan 100%, but to be thoughtful about how you spend your time</li>
<li>Quantify the Depth of Each Activity
<ul>
<li>Shallow work: noncoygnitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.</li>
<li>How long would it take to train a smart recent college grad with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget</li>
<li>Finish Your Work by 5:30
<ul>
<li>fixed-schedule productivity: set a limit of fight hours a week and work backward to determine what rules and habits were needed to satisfy that constraint</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Become Hard to Reach
<ul>
<li>Make people who send you email do more work</li>
<li>Do more work when you send or reply to emails
<ul>
<li>Determine the “project” represented by the email and find the most efficient process for concluding the project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t respond
<ul>
<li>Tim Ferriss: “Develop the habit of letting small and things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never mind time for the life-changing big things."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Winifred Gallagher: “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is."</li>
</ul>
