<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<li>"Sad things have indeed befallen you, but we must endure even the hardest adventures that God sends us." (33)</li>
<li>"And God knows well how to save his servants if so He wills." (112)</li>
<li>Sir Gareth: "The mightier mine enemies be, the greater my honor if I conquer them." (155)</li>
<li>Sir Gareth: "A knight who could not put up with hard words from a woman would be of little worth." (156)</li>
<li>"Know now, Sir knight, that by your mighty deeds greater glory than ever is come of Logres: for so always shall such as you bring good out of the workings of another's evil." (162)</li>
<li>"Rual took the boy, and never was child more kindly and lovingly fostered by his own parents than was Tristram by Rual and Rual's wife. And when he grew older Kurwenal the wise taught him many things: to play upon the harp and to play at chess; to use a sword and a spear, and to ride a horse: and he took him through many foreign lands so that he might learn to speak their languages." (170)</li>
<li>Sir Lancelot: "If you prove worthy, he will make you a knight. But not in great deeds of arms lies the true worth of knighthood—rather in the heart of the doer of such deeds: if he be pure and humble, doing all things to the glory of God and to bring that glory and that peace throughout all our holy kingdom of Logres." (231)</li>
<li>Sir Percivale's mother on chivalry: "go on your way now, and remember that if dame or damsel asks your aid, give it freely and before all else, seeking no reward. Yet you may kiss the maiden who is willing, but take no more than a kiss, unless it be a ring - but be that only when you place your own ring upon her finger. Beware in whose company you travel on your quest, and see to it that only worthy men come near to your heart: but above all, pray to God each day that He may be with you in all your deeds - and pass not by church nor chapel without pausing a while in His honor." (232)</li>
<li>"'I knew well that I was never the best,' said Sir Launcelot." (277)</li>
<li>"But go you forward, noble Sir Gallahad, and trust ever in God and not in your own earthly prowess." (286)</li>
<li>Bors: "For in purity of life and not in pride of deeds dwells that which makes a man worthy to achieve this quest. Go forward in the fear of God, and live to tell of the ending of the quest of the Holy Grail." (299)</li>
