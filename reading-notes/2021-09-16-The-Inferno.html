<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

  <p>We should fear those things alone<br />
  that have the power to harm.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 2. 88-89 (Beatrice)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-3-the-gates-of-hell">Inferno Canto 3 - <em>The Gates of Hell</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abandon all hope, you who enter here.</p>
  
  <p>And he to me: 'This miserable state is borne<br />
  by the wretched souls of those who lived<br />
  without disgrace yet without praise.<br />

<li>This is the "anti-inferno" or vestibule of hell for the neutrals who never took a side, cf. <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Rv-03#v15</text>. But mustn't we ultimately embrace God or reject Him?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>They have no hope of death,<br />
  and their blind life is so abject<br />
  that they are envious of every other lot.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 3. 46-48</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>52-57: Dante's <strong><em>contrapasso</em></strong>: punishment in his hell is the application of the opposite of the sin</li>
<li>58-60: "the great refusal" perhaps refers to Pope Celestine V who abdicated the papacy in 1294 (followed by Benedict XVI in 2013) and was later canonized</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-4-limbo">Inferno Canto 4 - <em>Limbo</em></h3>

<p>Limbo for Dante includes the virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants (compare with <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">St. Thomas Aquinas</text>'s limbo including the Hebrew saints and unbaptized infants), who are aware of the better life that is denied them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They did not sin. Though they have merit,<br />
  that is not enough, for they were unbaptized,<br />
  denied the gateway to the faith that you profess.<br />
  <br><br><br><br />
  And if they lived before the Christians lived,<br />
  they did not worship God aright.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 4. 34-38</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I understood, great sadness seized my heart,<br />
  for then I knew that being of great worth<br />
  were here suspended in this Limbo.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 4. 43-45</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First reference to Christ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was new to this condition when I saw<br />
  a mighty one descend, crowned, with a sign of victory.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 4. 53-54</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-5-lust">Inferno Canto 5 - <em>Lust</em></h3>

<p>We can either confess our sins to a priest (and obtain absolution), or to Minos to assign our place in hell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There stands Minos, snarling, terrible.<br />
  He examines each offender at the entrance,<br />
  judges and dispatches as he encoils himself.<br />
  <br><br />
  I mean that when the ill-begotten soul<br />
  stands there before him it confesses all,<br />
  and that accomplished judge of sins<br />
  <br><br />
  decides what place in Hell is fit for it,<br />
  then coils his tail around himself to count<br />
  how many circles down the soul must go.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 4-12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Echoes <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Mt-07#v13</text>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't let the easy entrance fool you.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dante's definition of lust is making "reason subject to desire". Hollander's notes reference the lust of <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">T. S. Eliot</text>'s <em>The Waste Land</em> 222-248</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>they who make reason subject to desire.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5.39</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no intercession in hell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if the King of the universe were our friend<br />
  we would pray that he might give you peace<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 91-92</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the sad analogy to <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Jb-01#v21</text> (Hollander's notes also reference <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em> by Boëtius: "among fortune's many adversities the most unhappy kind is once to have been happy"):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And she said to me: 'There is no greater sorrow<br />
  than to recall our time of joy<br />
  in wretchedness—and this your teacher knows.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 121-123</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-6-gluttony">Inferno Canto 6 - <em>Gluttony</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the pernicious fault of gluttony,<br />
  as you can see, I'm prostrate in this rain.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 6. 53-54</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pride, envy, and avarice are the sparks<br />
  that have set the hearts of all on fire.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 6. 74-75</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-7-avarice-prodigality">Inferno Canto 7 - <em>Avarice &amp; Prodigality</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>And why do our sins so waste us?<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 7. 21</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No you see, my son, what brief mockery<br />
  Fortune makes of goods we trust her with,<br />
  for which the race of men embroil themselves.<br />
  <br><br />
  All the gold that lies beneath the moon,<br />
  or ever did, could never give a moment's rest<br />
  to any of these wearies souls.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 7. 61-66</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The three kinds of anger for Aristotle and Thomas: choleric (comes and departs quickly), bitter (not released easily), and difficult (hostile and directed against those it should not be):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I, my gaze transfixed, could see<br />
  people with angry faces in that bog,<br />
  naked, their bodies smeared with mud.<br />
  <br><br />
  They struck each other with their hands,<br />
  their heads, their chests and feet,<br />
  and tore each other with their teeth.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 7. 109-114</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-8-anger-sullenness">Inferno Canto 8 - <em>Anger &amp; Sullenness</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reader, how could I not lose heart<br />
  at the sound of these accursèd words?<br />
  I thought I would never make it back.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 8. 94-96</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-9-heresy">Inferno Canto 9 - <em>Heresy</em></h3>

<p>The Furies represent the three main categories of sin: <em>incontinence</em>, <em>violence</em>, and <em>fraud</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O you who have sound intellects,<br />
  consider the teaching that is hidden<br />
  behind the veil of these strange verses.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 9. 61-63</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do you kick against that will<br />
  which never can be severed from its purpose?<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 9. 94-95</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For here the graves were strewn with flames<br />
  that made them glow with heat<br />
  hotter than iron is before it's worked.<br />
  <br><br />
  All their covers were propped open and from them<br />
  issued such dire lamentation it was clear<br />
  it came from wretches in despair and pain.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 9. 118-123</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heresy is a sin of the will due to the obstinacy of error (cf. <em><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">2021-08-12-Summa Theologiae</text></em>, II-II, q. 5, a. 3).</p>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-10-epicurians">Inferno Canto 10 - <em>Epicurians</em></h3>

<p>Epicurus: virtue was to be practiced because it led to happiness (the <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Stoic</text>s held that virtue should be cultivated for its own sake. To Dante, <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Epicurianism</text> is "the pleasure principle", or "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" (cf <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">1 Cor-15#v32</text>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here Epicurus and all his followers,<br />
   who hold the soul dies with the body,<br />
   have their burial place.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 10. 13-15</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We see, like those with faulty vision,<br />
   things at a distance, he replied. That much,<br />
   for us, the mighty Ruler's light still shines.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 10. 100-102</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-11-order-of-hell">Inferno Canto 11 - <em>Order of Hell</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every evil deed despised in Heaven<br />
  has as its end injustice. Each such end<br />
  harms someone else through either force or fraud.<br />
  <br><br />
  But since the vice of fraud is man's alone,<br />
  it more displeases God, and thus the fraudulent<br />
  are lower down, assailed by greater pain<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 11. 22-27</p>
</blockquote>

<p><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">2021-10-16 Question on Usury</text>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That human toil, as far as it is able,<br />
  follows nature, as the pupil does his master,<br />
  so that it is God's grandchild, as it were.<br />
  <br><br />
  By toil and nature, if you remember Genesis,<br />
  near the beginning, it is man's lot<br />
  to earn his bread and prosper.<br />
  <br><br />
  The usurer, who takes another path,<br />
  scorns nature in herself and in her follower,<br />
  and elsewhere sets his hopes.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 11. 103-111</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-12-violence">Inferno Canto 12 - <em>Violence</em></h3>

<p><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Progress &amp; History</text>: "This 'circular' theory of history is intrinsically opposed to the Christian view, in which Christ's establishment of love is as a universal principle redeemed history once and for all." (230)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The river of blood that scalds<br />
  those who by violence do injury to others.<br />
  <br><br />
  O blind covetousness, insensate wrath,<br />
  which in this brief life goad us on and then,<br />
  in the eternal, steep us in such misery!<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 12. 47-51</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Around the moat they go in thousands,<br />
  shooting arrows at any soul that rises<br />
  higher from the blood than guilt allows.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 12. 73-75</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-13-suicide">Inferno Canto 13 - <em>Suicide</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such pity fills my heart<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 13. 84</p>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-14-blasphemy">Inferno Canto 14 - <em>Blasphemy</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I was alive, I am in death.<br />

</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because your pride remains unquenched<br />
  you suffer greater punishment.<br />
  In your own anger lies your agony,<br />
  a fitting torment for your rage.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 14. 63-66</p>
