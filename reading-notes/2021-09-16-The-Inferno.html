<p><code>(New York: Anchor, 2000), 694</code></p>

<p>I'm reading the <em><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">~The Divine Comedy</text></em> as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://100daysofdante.com/">100 Days of Dante</a>.</p>

<p>==add notes==</p>

<p>Charles Williams answers best: “A thousand preachers have said all that Dante says and left their hearers discontented; why does Dante content? Because an image of profundity is there.”<br />

<blockquote>
  <p>Midway in the journey of our life<br />
  I came to myself in a dark wood,<br />
  for the straight way was lost.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 1. 1-3</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then a she-wolf who, all hide and bones,<br />
  seemed charged with all the appetites<br />
  that have made many live in wretchedness<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 1. 49-51</p>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-2-prologue">Inferno Canto 2 - <em>Prologue</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We should fear those things alone<br />
  that have the power to harm.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 2. 88-89 (Beatrice)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-3-the-gates-of-hell">Inferno Canto 3 - <em>The Gates of Hell</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abandon all hope, you who enter here.</p>
  
  <p>And he to me: 'This miserable state is borne<br />
  by the wretched souls of those who lived<br />
  without disgrace yet without praise.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 3. 34-35</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>This is the "anti-inferno" or vestibule of hell for the neutrals who never took a side, cf. <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Rv-03#v15</text>. But mustn't we ultimately embrace God or reject Him?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>They have no hope of death,<br />
  and their blind life is so abject<br />
  that they are envious of every other lot.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 3. 46-48</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>52-57: Dante's <strong><em>contrapasso</em></strong>: punishment in his hell is the application of the opposite of the sin</li>
<li>58-60: "the great refusal" perhaps refers to Pope Celestine V who abdicated the papacy in 1294 (followed by Benedict XVI in 2013) and was later canonized</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-4-limbo">Inferno Canto 4 - <em>Limbo</em></h3>

<p>Limbo for Dante includes the virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants (compare with <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">St. Thomas Aquinas</text>'s limbo including the Hebrew saints and unbaptized infants), who are aware of the better life that is denied them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They did not sin. Though they have merit,<br />
  that is not enough, for they were unbaptized,<br />
  denied the gateway to the faith that you profess.<br />
  <br><br><br><br />
  And if they lived before the Christians lived,<br />
  they did not worship God aright.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 4. 34-38</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I understood, great sadness seized my heart,<br />
  for then I knew that being of great worth<br />
  were here suspended in this Limbo.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 4. 43-45</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First reference to Christ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was new to this condition when I saw<br />
  a mighty one descend, crowned, with a sign of victory.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 4. 53-54</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-5-lust">Inferno Canto 5 - <em>Lust</em></h3>

<p>We can either confess our sins to a priest (and obtain absolution), or to Minos to assign our place in hell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There stands Minos, snarling, terrible.<br />
  He examines each offender at the entrance,<br />
  judges and dispatches as he encoils himself.<br />
  <br><br />
  I mean that when the ill-begotten soul<br />
  stands there before him it confesses all,<br />
  and that accomplished judge of sins<br />
  <br><br />
  decides what place in Hell is fit for it,<br />
  then coils his tail around himself to count<br />
  how many circles down the soul must go.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 4-12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Echoes <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Mt-07#v13</text>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't let the easy entrance fool you.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dante's definition of lust is making "reason subject to desire". Hollander's notes reference the lust of <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">T. S. Eliot</text>'s <em>The Waste Land</em> 222-248</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>they who make reason subject to desire.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5.39</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no intercession in hell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if the King of the universe were our friend<br />
  we would pray that he might give you peace<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 91-92</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the sad analogy to <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Jb-01#v21</text> (Hollander's notes also reference <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em> by Boëtius: "among fortune's many adversities the most unhappy kind is once to have been happy"):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And she said to me: 'There is no greater sorrow<br />
  than to recall our time of joy<br />
  in wretchedness—and this your teacher knows.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 5. 121-123</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-6-gluttony">Inferno Canto 6 - <em>Gluttony</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the pernicious fault of gluttony,<br />
  as you can see, I'm prostrate in this rain.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 6. 53-54</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pride, envy, and avarice are the sparks<br />
  that have set the hearts of all on fire.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 6. 74-75</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-7-avarice-prodigality">Inferno Canto 7 - <em>Avarice &amp; Prodigality</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>And why do our sins so waste us?<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 7. 21</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No you see, my son, what brief mockery<br />
  Fortune makes of goods we trust her with,<br />
  for which the race of men embroil themselves.<br />
  <br><br />
  All the gold that lies beneath the moon,<br />
  or ever did, could never give a moment's rest<br />
  to any of these wearies souls.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 7. 61-66</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The three kinds of anger for Aristotle and Thomas: choleric (comes and departs quickly), bitter (not released easily), and difficult (hostile and directed against those it should not be):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I, my gaze transfixed, could see<br />
  people with angry faces in that bog,<br />
  naked, their bodies smeared with mud.<br />
  <br><br />
  They struck each other with their hands,<br />
  their heads, their chests and feet,<br />
  and tore each other with their teeth.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 7. 109-114</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-8-anger-sullenness">Inferno Canto 8 - <em>Anger &amp; Sullenness</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reader, how could I not lose heart<br />
  at the sound of these accursèd words?<br />
  I thought I would never make it back.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 8. 94-96</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-9-heresy">Inferno Canto 9 - <em>Heresy</em></h3>

<p>The Furies represent the three main categories of sin: <em>incontinence</em>, <em>violence</em>, and <em>fraud</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O you who have sound intellects,<br />
  consider the teaching that is hidden<br />
  behind the veil of these strange verses.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 9. 61-63</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do you kick against that will<br />
  which never can be severed from its purpose?<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 9. 94-95</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For here the graves were strewn with flames<br />
  that made them glow with heat<br />
  hotter than iron is before it's worked.<br />
  <br><br />
  All their covers were propped open and from them<br />
  issued such dire lamentation it was clear<br />
  it came from wretches in despair and pain.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 9. 118-123</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heresy is a sin of the will due to the obstinacy of error (cf. <em><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">2021-08-12-Summa Theologiae</text></em>, II-II, q. 5, a. 3).</p>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-10-epicurians">Inferno Canto 10 - <em>Epicurians</em></h3>

<p>Epicurus: virtue was to be practiced because it led to happiness (the <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Stoic</text>s held that virtue should be cultivated for its own sake. To Dante, <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Epicurianism</text> is "the pleasure principle", or "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" (cf <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">1 Cor-15#v32</text>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here Epicurus and all his followers,<br />
   who hold the soul dies with the body,<br />
   have their burial place.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 10. 13-15</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We see, like those with faulty vision,<br />
   things at a distance, he replied. That much,<br />
   for us, the mighty Ruler's light still shines.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 10. 100-102</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-11-order-of-hell">Inferno Canto 11 - <em>Order of Hell</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every evil deed despised in Heaven<br />
  has as its end injustice. Each such end<br />
  harms someone else through either force or fraud.<br />
  <br><br />
  But since the vice of fraud is man's alone,<br />
  it more displeases God, and thus the fraudulent<br />
  are lower down, assailed by greater pain<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 11. 22-27</p>
</blockquote>

<p><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Usury</text>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That human toil, as far as it is able,<br />
  follows nature, as the pupil does his master,<br />
  so that it is God's grandchild, as it were.<br />
  <br><br />
  By toil and nature, if you remember Genesis,<br />
  near the beginning, it is man's lot<br />
  to earn his bread and prosper.<br />
  <br><br />
  The usurer, who takes another path,<br />
  scorns nature in herself and in her follower,<br />
  and elsewhere sets his hopes.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 11. 103-111</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-12-violence">Inferno Canto 12 - <em>Violence</em></h3>

<p><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Circular vs linear history</text>: "This 'curcular' theory of history is intrinsically opposed to the Christian view, in which Christ's establishement of love is as a universal principle redeemed history once and for all." (230)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The river of blood that scalds<br />
  those who by violence do injury to others.<br />
  <br><br />
  O blind covetousness, insensate wrath,<br />
  which in this brief life goad us on and then,<br />
  in the eternal, steep us in such misery!<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 12. 47-51</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Around the moat they go in thousands,<br />
  shooting arrows at any soul that rises<br />
  higher from the blood than guilt allows.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 12. 73-75</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-13-suicide">Inferno Canto 13 - <em>Suicide</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such pity fills my heart<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 13. 84</p>
</blockquote>

<p>St. Jerome's comment on <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Ps-08</text>: "Judas offended God more greatly by hanging himself than by betraying Him." (253)</p>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-14-blasphemy">Inferno Canto 14 - <em>Blasphemy</em></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>And here the dreadful work of justice is revealed.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 14. 6</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Contrapasso</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I was alive, I am in death.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 14. 51</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because your pride remains unquenched<br />
  you suffer greater punishment.<br />
  In your own anger lies your agony,<br />
  a fitting torment for your rage.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 14. 63-66</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-15">Inferno Canto 15</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kc-uhYxR1a0?t=283">video</a>: Primo Levi's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Auschwitz-Primo-Levi/dp/0684826801"><em>Survival In Auschwitz</em></a> tells of how he recited lines from the <em>Inferno</em> to remember his humanity in Auschwitz</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By following your star<br />
  you cannot fail to reach a glorious port<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 15. 55-56</p>
</blockquote>

<p><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Writing</text>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You taught me how man makes himself immortal.<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 15. 85</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inferno-canto-16">Inferno Canto 16</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The three...looked at one another<br />
  as men do when they face the truth<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 16. 76-78</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ah, how cautious we should be with those<br />
  who do not see our actions only,<br />
  but with their wisdom peer into our thoughts!<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 16. 118-120</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To a truth that bears the face of falsehood<br />
  a man should seal his lips if he is able,<br />
  for it might shame him, through no fault of his<br />

<blockquote>
  <p>I watched horned demons armed with heavy scourges<br />
  lashing them cruelly from behind.<br />
  <br><br />
  Ah, how they made them pick their heels up<br />
  at the first stroke! You may be certain<br />
  no one waited for a second or a third.<br />

  <p>O Simon Magus, o wretches of his band,<br />

</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O Supreme Wisdom, what great art you show<br />
  in Heaven, on earth, and in the evil world,<br />
  and what true justice does your power dispense!<br />
  –<em>Inferno</em> Canto 19. 10-12</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Along the sides and bottom I could see<br />
  the livid stone was pierced with holes,<br />
  all round and of a single size.<br />
  ...<br />
  From the mouth of each stuck out<br />
  a sinner's feet and legs up to the thighs<br />
  while all the rest stayed in the hole.<br />
  <br><br />
  They all had both their soles on fire.<br />
