<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<li>Outline:
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 is history of America </li>
<li>Chapters 3-7 outline where we are now and how we got there</li>
<li>Chapters 8-12 speak to our reasons for hope and how we can live as Christians with joy </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 2 - History 
<ul>
<li>Kraynak's themes of the Founders' vision:
<ul>
<li>Republicanism: balance of power; division of power; class representation; ensure sovereignty but moderate majority rule </li>
<li>Constitutionalism: single document created new; can change but difficult to lint passions</li>
<li>Natural law: moral order </li>
<li>Cultural tradition: greater narrative, humility about our place in the world </li>
</ul></li>
<li>America is a Protestant nation from the beginning without a previous catholic culture. <a href="../notes/G.K.-Chesterton.html">G.K. Chesterton</a>: "America has always been a nation that thinks it's a church." (34)</li>
<li>Rise of Catholics though the world wars mixing patriotism and church, culminating in the rise of JFK</li>

<ul>
<li>It is important to catalog the ways our culture is changing to understand if we need to fix it or if it's healthy</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 6 - Truth
<ul>
<li>Democracy leads to over importance of public opinion where we are more comfortable with lies or half truths to fit in than seeking truth but risking social harm</li>
<li>So we have two powerful forces that drive our lives: public opinion (wanting to not stick out) and the market economy </li>

<li>Thought experiment from After Virtue...we use the same words for morality but they have lost their meaning (126-127)</li>
<li>"The enlightenment tried to keep the more content of Christianity while eliminating its religious base. But it doesn't work. The biblical grounding can't be cut away without undermining the whole moral system. Every attempt to build a substitute system has suffered from incoherence, no matter how reasonable sounding."

<li>Liberal education is important to move beyond cogs in STEM machine, and because we need educated people for democracy  to work </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Law, courts, legal profession 
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>Character 
<ul>

<li>"mercy is the musical key in which God's justice is played" (178)</li>
<li>"purity of heart isn't limited to matters of sex. It's about not letting lesser loves or sins distract us from the Lord… Purity, then, comes from having our bodies, minds, hearts, and souls conformed to Jesus Christ, united in purpose by his love. (180-181)</li>

<li>Nature is sacramental </li>
<li>Real beauty leads us to the three virtues of humility, love, and hope</li>
<li>"But sexuality-related issues are not a separate, idiosyncratic corner of Catholic thought. They're deeply connected to much broader issues of personal and social morality and the organization of society." (238)</li>
