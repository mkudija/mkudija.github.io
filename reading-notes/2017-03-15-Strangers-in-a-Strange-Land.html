<li>Outline:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Chapter 2 is history of America </li><br />
<li>Chapters 3-7 outline where we are now and how we got there</li><br />
<li>Chapters 8-12 speak to our reasons for hope and how we can live as Christians with joy </li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 2 - History<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Kraynak's themes of the Founders' vision:<br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>Republicanism: balance of power; division of power; class representation; ensure sovereignty but moderate majority rule </li><br /><br />
<li>Constitutionalism: single document created new; can change but difficult to lint passions</li><br /><br />
<li>Natural law: moral order </li><br /><br />
<li>Cultural tradition: greater narrative, humility about our place in the world </li><br /><br />
</ul></li><br />
<li>America is a Protestant nation from the beginning without a previous catholic culture. Chesterton: "America has always been a nation that thinks it's a church." (34)</li><br />
<li>Rise of Catholics though the world wars mixing patriotism and church, culminating in the rise of JFK</li><br />
<li>Closes with American idealism and stating that America can only endure with its structure as long as there are leaders who embody the philosophy of the founders</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 3<br />
<ul><br />
<li>It is important to catalog the ways our culture is changing to understand if we need to fix it or if it's healthy</li><br />
<li>"The surest way to transform a culture is from the inside out. And the sheer path to doing it isn't through reasoned debate or violence but by colonizing and reshaping the culture's appetites and behaviors" (46)</li><br />
<li>52, discussion of the far reaching implications of the pill</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 4 - Beauty in Nature<br />

</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 5 - marriage<br />
<ul><br />
<li>American individualism sets the stage for instability in romantic relationships </li><br />
<li>Discussion of relativism and transgenderism </li><br />
<li>Marital intimacy, and the separation of sexual expression from childbearing </li><br />
<li>Throwaway culture vs culture of encounter (Francis) &gt; the family is where we build culture of encounter</li><br />
<li>As traditional authority and structure disintegrates (family, church), it is replaced with government, which is less human (100-101)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 6 - Truth<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Democracy leads to over importance of public opinion where we are more comfortable with lies or half truths to fit in than seeking truth but risking social harm</li><br />
<li>So we have two powerful forces that drive our lives: public opinion (wanting to not stick out) and the market economy </li><br />
<li>We grow in truth by seeking it continually (if not, it fades from view) (113)</li><br />
<li>We can't just blame "the culture" because we are the culture (117)</li><br />

<li>Chapter 7 -<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Thought experiment from After Virtue...we use the same words for morality but they have lost their meaning (126-127)</li><br />
<li>"The enlightenment tried to keep the more content of Christianity while eliminating its religious base. But it doesn't work. The biblical grounding can't be cut away without undermining the whole moral system. Every attempt to build a substitute system has suffered from incoherence, no matter how reasonable sounding." (130)</li><br />

<li>Liberal education names to know: Anthony Esolen, Allan Bloom, Neil Postman, Matthew Crawford, Alastair MacIntyre</li><br /><br /><br />
<li>Liberal education is important to move beyond cogs in STEM machine, and because we need educated people for democracy  to work </li><br /><br /><br />
</ul></li><br /><br />
<li>Law, courts, legal profession<br /><br /><br />
<ul><br /><br /><br />

<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->
