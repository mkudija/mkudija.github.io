# *The Gospel of John*

Listened to this in 2025 while riding my bike, finished on these dates:

1. [[2025-01-12-Sun]]
2. [[2025-01-25-Sat]]
	- "we" in [[Jn-03]] with Nicodemus: trinity? 
	- [[Jn-05#v46]]: "Moses wrote of me" (cf. [[Nm-21#v9]], [[Dt-18#v15]])
	- [[Jn-12#v48]]: "The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day"
3. [[2025-05-10-Sat]]
	- Come to the light, [[Jn-03#v20]]-21: "For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God."
	- Worship in spirit and truth, [[Jn-04#v23]]-24: "But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
4. [[2025-05-26-Mon]]
	- [[Jn-05#v22]]-23: "The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son."
	- [[Jn-08#v55]]: "I keep his word." (we should strive to do likewise)
	- [[Jn-15#v5]]: "Apart from me you can do nothing."
	- His words should abide in us (why to [[Memorize Scripture]]), [[Jn-15#v7]]: "If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."
5.
