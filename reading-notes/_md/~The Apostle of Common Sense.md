`(San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2003), 190`

I started reading this on my Kindle before meeting Dale Ahlquist at a [[Chesterton Academy of St. Benedict]] event. 


## Preface
- Dale Ahlquist read *The Everlasting Man* on his honeymoon
- Chesterton's faith cannot be ignored and is not just one aspect of his work, but the "dome over it all"

## Chapter 1: An Introduction to the Apostle of Common Sense
- "G.K. Chesterton was the best writer of the twentieth century. He said something about everything, and he said it better than anybody else." 
- "Students should not consider themselves educated until they have read him. Furthermore, reading Chesterton is almost a complete education in itself." 
- "Why is Chesterton neglected? Because the modern world finds it much more convenient to ignore him than to risk engaging him in an argument, because to argue with Chesterton is to lose." 
- Chesterton doesn't avoid controversy, and he doesn't avoid religion and politics, because we are commanded to love *God* and our *neighbor* (the subject of both)
- Chesterton is a [[2013-03-13-The Complete Thinker|Complete Thinker]], and utterly consistent because his faith touched everything.
- His ideas aren't exotic, but he expresses them better than anyone else can and represents common sense.


## Chapter 2: Orthodoxy
- If you only read one book by Chesterton it has to be *[[2014-10-06-Orthodoxy|Orthodoxy]]*: "This is the trunk of the tree from which all other branches of Chesterton grow. It is a masterpiece of rhetoric; it has never been out of print since it was first published in 1908, and it is simply one of the best books written in the twentieth century."
- The first steps are the most important—the difference between getting home and getting lost—and the first step is to accept the reality of sin. The next step is to accept the limits of reason.
