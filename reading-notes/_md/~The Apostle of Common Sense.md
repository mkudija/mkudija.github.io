I started reading this on my Kindle before meeting Dale Ahlquist at a [[Chesterton Academy of St. Benedict]] event. 


## Preface
- Dale Ahlquist read *The Everlasting Man* on his honeymoon
- Chesterton's faith cannot be ignored and is not just one aspect of his work, but the "dome over it all"

## Chapter 1: An Introduction to the Apostle of Common Sense
- "G.K. Chesterton was the best writer of the twentieth century. He said something about everything, and he said it better than anybody else." 
- "Students should not consider themselves educated until they have read him. Furthermore, reading Chesterton is almost a complete education in itself." 
- "Why is Chesterton neglected? Because the modern world finds it much more convenient to ignore him than to risk engaging him in an argument, because to argue with Chesterton is to lose." 
- Chesterton doesn't avoid controversy, and he doesn't avoid religion and politics, because we are commanded to love *God* and our *neighbor* (the subject of both)
- Chesterton is a [[2013-03-13-The Complete Thinker|Complete Thinker]], and utterly consistent because his faith touched everything.
- His ideas aren't exotic, but he expresses them better than anyone else can and represents common sense.

## Chapter 2: Orthodoxy
- If you only read one book by Chesterton it has to be *[[2014-10-06-Orthodoxy|Orthodoxy]]*: "This is the trunk of the tree from which all other branches of Chesterton grow. It is a masterpiece of rhetoric; it has never been out of print since it was first published in 1908, and it is simply one of the best books written in the twentieth century."
- The first steps are the most important—the difference between getting home and getting lost—and the first step is to accept the reality of sin. The next step is to accept the limits of reason and accept the concept of *paradox*, one of the most important themes throughout Chesterton's writing.
- Chesterton rejects determinism (fatalism) and holds up free will as one of the most sacred truths of Catholic theology. Freedom is glorious, but freedom is enjoyed only within the rules. 
- "Chesterton discovered that paradox is the key to truth, and that the ultimate paradox is the key to the ultimate truth. And the ultimate paradox is Jesus Christ: fully God and fully man." 
- Only truth brings freedom, and truth does not change. 

## Chapter 3: Heretics
- *Heretics* is one of Chesterton's most important and most neglected books. 
- Religion is never irrelevant because we all hold some "religion" that determines how we act. Religion deals with everything. 
- "The Christian faith is common sense. Heresy, it turns out, is usually a distinct lack of common sense. A heresy is at best a half-truth, but usually even less than that. A heresy is a fragment of the truth that is exaggerated at the expense of the rest of the truth. Heresy is not so much a false doctrine as an incomplete doctrine."
- "The reason why Chesterton is an apostle of common sense is that he is a [[2013-03-13-The Complete Thinker|complete thinker]]. The reason he could recognize heresy is because he could exposure incomplete thinking." 
- "The Christian mystic, says Chesterton, is the most practical man of all. He does the right thing for the right reason."
- "It was the anti-Christian writers who pointed out all the common sense in Christianity. in the same way it is often the agnostics and scoffers who provide some of the best evidence for the very existence of God." 
- You cannot have progress unless you have established what your goal is: "Nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal...For progress is by its very name indicates a direction."
- [[Scientism]]: "Take away the supernatural and what remains is the unnatural."
- The chapter "On Certain Modern Writers and the Institution of the Family" is the quintessential Chesterton essay: If we can get along in a family, we can get along in other lesser human institutions.

## Chapter 4: What's Wrong with the World
- "The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried." 
- Hudge is Big Government, Gudge is Big Business 
- The society is in danger when the common man—without religion, home, and family—is not even sure what he wants anymore. 
- [[Generalism]]: Specialization is the enemy of democracy and the enemy of religion. Women have been the key persons preventing the degeneration into specialization. 
	- "Chesterton quite frankly does not want women to become involved in government—not because he does not want women to have more power, but because he does not want government to have more power." 
- "[[Education]] is only truth in a state of transmission." 
- "Chesterton's solution is that we have to repent and return to the Christian ideal. The only step forward is a step back."

-
