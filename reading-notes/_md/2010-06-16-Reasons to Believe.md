# *Reasons to Believe* by Scott Hahn

- Ch. 1: As St. Peter said, we have a responsibility to develop our ability to defend our faith with reason.
- Ch. 2:
 - Faith and reason are both important for living our lives like two wings of a bird/plane, interdependent in the way of spouses (Faith and Reason, JP2).
 - Science requires faith in order for it to function properly.
 - Logic:
 - Principle of Non-contradiction
 - General reliability of sense perception
 - Principle of causality
 - Notion of self-consciousness
- "The attractive power of the Catholic faith is the way it all hangs together: the natural, the biblical, and the theological.  It's integrated, just as all that has come from God is recognizable as His own" (137).
