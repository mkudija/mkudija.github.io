## Prologue
- The book grew out of a seminar at Yale Divinity School in the 1980's
- He takes the teachings of the Desert Fathers (specifically *Apophthegmata Patrum* [[bib]] and applies them to ministry in the 20th century)
- This book explores: *flee*, *be silent*, and *pray*

# Solitude 

## Introduction
- [[St. Anthony, Abbot]], as told to us by [[St. Athanasius]], shows how [[solitude]] is the furnace in which the transformation from the false, compulsive self into the new self of Jesus Christ takes place (10)

## The Compulsive Minister
- Our world is not safe and we must "swim for our lives from the shipwreck" of the seductive compulsions of the world (11, cf. [[Thomas Merton]] in *The Wisdom of the Desert* [[bib]]) 
- Nouwen's description of a worldly ministry on 12 is pretty depressing: of course our churches will fall apart if they are led with people with the priorities he describes here
- "The secular self is fabricated by social compulsions" (13, again cf. [[Thomas Merton|Merton]])
	- → this description, though written 40 years ago, makes a modern argument for [[avoiding social media]]
- The two main enemies of the spiritual life are anger and greed (13)

## The Furnace of Transformation 
- [[Solitude]] is the furnace of transformation...without solitude we remain victims of our society (15)
- "...evoke images of medieval ascetical pursuits from which Luther and Calvin have saved us." (16)
	- → how is this different than the ascetical pursuits of the Desert Fathers he praises?
- Don't mistake solitude with a mere private therapeutic place; it is rather a place of conversion where the old self dies to the new (17)
- "The wisdom of the desert is that the confrontation with our own frightening nothingness forces us to surrender ourselves totally and unconditionally to the Lord Jesus Christ." (19)
