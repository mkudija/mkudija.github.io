- ordered from Amazon 2023-11-20 for $59.37 (returned [[2024-01-30-Tue]] because no deuterocanon)
	- such a lovely little Bible, and would be one of my favorites with the deuterocanon
	- pretty easy to hold with one hand in bed
	- I was more impressed with the imitation leather version than I thought I would be 
	- silver gilding isn't my favorite, and wish it was red letter like the [[~Cambridge ESV Diadem Reference Bible with Apocrypha Red Calfskin|Cambridge ESV Diadem]]
- typeset in 6.75pt on 7pt Lexicon No. 1 by Blue Heron Bookcraft, Battle Ground WA, USA 
- Printed and bound in the Netherlands
