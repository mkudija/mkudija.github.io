# *What Is A Man*

* "O what a wonderful thing is love, which makes a man shine with so many virtues and everyone, no matter who he is, so many good traits of character! There is another thing about love that we should not praise in few words: it adorns a man with the virtue of chastity, because he who shines with the light of one love can hardly think of embracing another woman, even a beautiful one. For when he thinks deeply of his beloved, the sight of any other woman seems to his mind rough and rude." - Andreas Capellanus
