## Introduction 
- The first eight councils before the schism were conducted in Greek. The next ten Western councils before the Reformation were conducted in Latin. (1)
- Ecumenical council: a gathering of the bishops of the entire world under the presidency of the Pope. "Ecumenical" comes from the Greek *oíkoumene* meaning "the inhabited world" (2)
- The ecumenical council is the supreme teaching authority in the Catholic Church (3)
- "Generalization about the ecumenical councils can be a hazardous practice." (8)
- "When we bear in mind that faith involves mysteries, we can understand that some theologians, trying to give shape and comprehension to those mysteries, would come up with formulas that the larger church would later reject. We should see them not always as heretics but sometimes as sincere Christians genuinely trying to make sense of their belief." (8)
	- **Heterodoxy**: deviation from commonly accepted teaching 
	- **Heresy**: conscious deviation from a publicly stated doctrinal position of the church 

## Chapter 1: The Trinitarian Councils
_**Summary**: _
- Nicea I met because of two momentous events in Christian history: the advent of the first Christian emperor, and the final reckoning of trinitarian theology. (16)
	- 312: Constantine secures his throne in the Battle of Milvian bridge via the ☧
	- 313: Edit of Milan legalizes Christianity in the empire, but also leads to imperial interference in the Church 
	- 324: Constantine becomes emperor of East and West, and founds Constantinople 
	- 325: Constantine calls the First Council of Nicea 
- Trinitarian debates arose as the Church attempted to articulate how Jesus was divine yet maintain monotheism.
	- [[Monarchianism]]: emphasizes the unity of the three persons of the trinity to the point of denying the distinct existence of Son and Spirit, developed by theologians in Rome to avoid a slide back into polytheism 
		- [[Modalism]]: a form of Monarchianism teaching that "Son" and "Spirit" are names for the different forms or "modes" of the Father's activity
		- [[Adoptionism]]: a form of Monarchianism teaching that Jesus was a good man in whom God dwelt as a divine power
	- [[Tertullian]] advanced trinitarian theology with useful terminology: *trinitas*, *substantia*, *persona*: in the trinity the three persons partake in the divine substance.
	- [[Arianism|Arius]] taught that Jesus is subordinate because he is not divine: "there was when he was not"
- Nicea I: 
	- *Homooúsious* (*consubstantialis*) was chosen to pin Arius down
	- Common date of Easter 
	- Set the pattern of issuing decrees (dogmatic statements) and canons (ordinances)
- The period after Nicea was "genuinely traumatic"—per Julian: "Wild animals do not attack one another as fiercely as do these Christians."
	- [[St. Athanasius|Athanasius]] defended Nicea but was a polarizing figure.
	- The Cappadocian fathers (Basil of Caesarea, [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and Gregory Nazianzen) secured the legacy of Nicea by showing that in the Trinity are one *ousía* and three hypostatses, equating *ousía* with the Latin notion of substance and *hypóstasis* with the Latin notion of person.
