## Introduction 
- The first eight councils before the schism were conducted in Greek. The next ten Western councils before the Reformation were conducted in Latin. (1)
- Ecumenical council: a gathering of the bishops of the entire world under the presidency of the Pope. "Ecumenical" comes from the Greek *oíkoumene* meaning "the inhabited world" (2)
- The ecumenical council is the supreme teaching authority in the Catholic Church (3)
- "Generalization about the ecumenical councils can be a hazardous practice." (8)
- "When we bear in mind that faith involves mysteries, we can understand that some theologians, trying to give shape and comprehension to those mysteries, would come up with formulas that the larger church would later reject. We should see them not always as heretics but sometimes as sincere Christians genuinely trying to make sense of their belief." (8)
	- **Heterodoxy**: deviation from commonly accepted teaching 
	- **Heresy**: conscious deviation from a publicly stated doctrinal position of the church 

## Chapter 1: The Trinitarian Councils
_**Summary**: _
- Nicea I met because of two momentous events in Christian history: the advent of the first Christian emperor, and the final reckoning of trinitarian theology. (16)
	- 312: Constantine secures his throne in the Battle of Milvian bridge via the ☧
	- 313: Edit of Milan legalizes Christianity in the empire, but also leads to imperial interference in the Church 
	- 324: Constantine becomes emperor of East and West, and founds Constantinople 
	- 325: Constantine calls the First Council of Nicea 
- Trinitarian debates arose as the Church attempted to articulate how Jesus was divine yet maintain monotheism.
	- [[Monarchianism]]: emphasizes the unity of the three persons of the trinity to the point of denying the distinct existence of Son and Spirit, developed by theologians in Rome to avoid a slide back into polytheism 
		- [[Modalism]]: a form of Monarchianism teaching that "Son" and "Spirit" are names for the different forms or "modes" of the Father's activity
		- [[Adoptionism]]: a form of Monarchianism teaching that Jesus was a good man in whom God dwelt as a divine power
	- [[Tertullian]] advanced trinitarian theology with useful terminology: *trinitas*, *substantia*, *persona*: in the trinity the three persons partake in the divine substance.
	- [[Arianism|Arius]] taught that Jesus is subordinate because he is not divine: "there was when he was not"
- **Nicea I**: 
	- *Homooúsious* (*consubstantialis*) was chosen to pin Arius down
	- Common date of Easter 
	- Set the pattern of issuing decrees (dogmatic statements) and canons (ordinances)
- The period after Nicea was "genuinely traumatic"—per Julian: "Wild animals do not attack one another as fiercely as do these Christians."
	- [[St. Athanasius|Athanasius]] defended Nicea but was a polarizing figure.
	- The Cappadocian fathers (Basil of Caesarea, [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and Gregory Nazianzen) secured the legacy of Nicea by showing that in the Trinity are one *ousía* and three hypostatses, equating *ousía* with the Latin notion of substance and *hypóstasis* with the Latin notion of person. 
- **Constantinople I**:
	- Deals with trinitarian doctrine, confirming the doctrine of Nicea and affirmed the divinity of the Holy Spirit 
	- Illustrates the relation of the papacy to an ecumenical council: Damasus of Rome not notified, but later popes accepted the council 
	- [[St. Gregory Nazianzen|Gregory of Nazianzus]] was promoted to the see of Constantinople and made president of the Council, but the Alexandrians objected so he resigned and Nectarius was appointed by the emperor—since he was a catechumen he was ordained a bishop in his baptismal robes (30)
	- Third canon: "The Bishop of Constantinople shall have primacy of honor after the Bishop of Rome because Constantinople is the new Rome." (30)
	- The reception of the council was slow and challenging: Rome did not accept the third canon, and Eastern bishops were suspicious of the addition to the creed. But it succeeded in finishing off Arianism. (31)


## Chapter 2: The Christological Councils
_**Summary**: How can Christ be both human and divine?_
- Mortification: "The monks died a little bit every day via rigorous fasting and discipline." (33)
- [[Docetism]]: A spiritual being like God would be corrupted by contact with a fleshy body. Christ did not have a real body, but only seemed to.
- [[Gnosticism]]: Held a low opinion of the body as the prison of the soul. 
- [[Nestorianism]]: Denial of the divine-human union in Christ; Mary as *Christotokos* but not *Theotokos*
- [[Apolooinarianism]]: the elimination of the divine-human distinction
- [[John Cassian]] opposed Nestorius (39)
- **Ephesus**
	- Called by the emperor Theodosius to support Nestorius in 431
	- Cyril's machinations led to three separate councils before various parties arrived, and ended with him and Nestorius both sent as prisoners to Constantinople, where he coaxed the emperor along with bribes. 
- **Chalcedon**
	- Leo's *Tome* was the first time a Pope-theologian's writings influenced the outcome of a council 
	- Christ is one person with two natures, one human and one divine. Two natures "without confusion, change, division, separation"
	- After the council, Monophysitism (one nature) spread in the east 
- The first four ecumenical councils are the most important because they:
	- Established a method of elucidating doctrine when Scripture alone could not do so 
	- Established the teachings of God and Christ 


## Chapter 3: The Byzantine Councila
_**Summary**: _
- Doctrine of the Two Swords (Pope Gelasius I: 492-96): the emperor holds the secular sword and the Pope the spiritual sword; the emperor ought to defer to the Pope in spiritual matters. 
- Emperor Justinian was motivated to reconcile with the Monophysites in the Eastern empire for political reasons 
- **Constantinople II**: 
	- Condemned the Three Chapters (the writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrrus, and Ibas)
	- Also condemned the writings of Origen, leading to a widespread destruction of his works 
	- Pope Vigilius initially held out, but accepted the council before he died
