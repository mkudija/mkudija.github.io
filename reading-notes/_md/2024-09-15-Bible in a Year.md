### Notes 
- [[2024-06-06-Thu]]-[[Gn-02#v5]] etc: "till" the ground (RSV2CE) is better than "work" the ground (ESV)
- [[2024-06-06-Thu]]-[[Gn-04#v16]]: "east of Eden", like *[[~East of Eden|East of Eden]]*
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-14#v14]]: didn’t realize Abram was a great commander
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-14#v3]], 5: "Your servant" is like the mass line "your servant/my soul"
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-18#v27]]: Abraham addressing God while interceding for Sodom and Gomorrah illustrates the humility we should have before God when we pray: "I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes."
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-19#v16]]: What feels rough to us may in fact be God's mercy, as when God saves Lot from the men of Sodom: "So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him."
- ==another "your servant" in [[Gn-19#v19]] (Lot speaking to God)==
- ==[[2024-06-08-Sat]] on prayer: ==

- [[2024-06-14-Fri]]-[[Ex-20#v25]] says "And if you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you wield your tool upon it you profane it." ==Why does hewing a stone profane it, and how do we reconcile this with a theology of work?==
