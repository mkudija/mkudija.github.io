## Ch 4  
- Chatterton’s Vietnam medic mentor: “How will I want to feel about this decision when I’m an old man? That’s the question for making important decisions.”  
- Chatterton's principles from Vietnam (from [[Dad]] 2021-08-14):
	- if easy, someone else already would have done it; if you follow in another's footsteps you miss the problems really worth solving
	- excellence is born of preparation, dedication, focus, and tenacity: compromise on any of these and you become average
	- every so often life presents a great moment of decision: you live with these decisions forever
	- examine everything, not all is as it seems or as people tell you
	- the guy who doesn't care, who says "I'm already dead and all that matters is the accounting I give of myself" is the most formidable force in the world
	- the worst possible decision is to give up
