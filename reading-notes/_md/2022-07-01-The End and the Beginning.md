I spent 2018 through 2020 reading William Manchester's *[[~The Last Lion|The Last Lion]]* trilogy on Churchill, and am now for 2021 through 2023 reading Weigel's trilogy on John Paul II. The first installment, *[[2021-07-20-Witness to Hope|Witness to Hope]]* was an epic journey. This second installment, *The End and the Beginning*, starts with a recap of Karol Wojtyła's life to date. But the primary focus is on the buildup to the Great Jubilee of 2000 and his last years, as well as a comprehensive look at the accomplishments and frustrations of his pontificate.

Weigel emphasizes the same themes of John Paul's pontificate: especially the "law of the gift" (48, 355), how the church proposes but never imposes (437), and the Christian humanism he so consistently preached (517). 

Sitting here in 2022, there are many lessons we can draw from his life. The teachings of the Church are perennial and timeless. John Paul preached these unchanging truths in a way that addressed the particular challenges of his (and still our) time. Interpreting and implementing Vatican II is a massive work that John Paul II focused much of his energy on, but that work is not complete. We are the generation charged with implementing Vatican II[^vatican2]. 

[^vatican2]: cf [[002- Becoming Saints in Our Time - The Burrowshire Podcast#^e1167a]]

John Paul II also warns Europe about the consequences of abandoning its Christian roots (334). At stake is our entire culture, including especially the Christian tradition of human rights. Events since his death make this warning all the more important and all the more general: the challenge is certainly not isolated to Europe. 

Finally, John Paul II always said that "You must decide!" (42, 412). And so it is with us: we must decide how to respond to Christ's call in our lives for this is "the same yesterday, today, and forever" (cf [[Heb-13#v8]]).

## Prologue: The Millennial Pope 
- He described himself as a "[[2021-07-20-Witness to Hope|Witness to Hope]]" to the UN in 1995 (2)
- His friend/mentor Jan Tyranowski was "a lay mystic and autodidact specialist in the works of [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[St. Teresa of Ávila]]" (6)
	- → not a bad goal to strive for!
- [[John Paul II]] held the conviction that "the [[Enlightenment]] theories of ethics, which locked moral obligation inside human consciousness, were one source of the cultural, and ultimately political, crises of the late twentieth century." (10)
- Under his leadership, the Diocese of Krakow published a summary of the documents of [[Vatican II]]: *Sources of Renewal* [[bib]] (11)
- His first encyclical *Redemptoris Hominis* [[bib]] was the first first extensive papal exposition of Christian anthropology (13)

# Part I: [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] vs. Communism

## Chapter 1: Opening Gambits
_[[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]]'s worldview against communism._
- Starts with the badass story of Witold Pilecki, who was intentionally arrested and sent to Auschwitz, built a radio and sent intelligence reports from there, and then escaped (24-26)
- Poland played a critical role in 20th century world history: the "Miracle on the Vistula" (stopping the Red Army in 1920), offering the first armed resistance to Hitler, epicenter of the nonviolent revolution against communism (27)
- Poland was also the most intensely Catholic country, and the Church suffered terribly but was a repository of the national identity and memory (28)
- Poland showed how "cultural and spiritual sovereignty can resist, and eventually defeat, the harshest political regimes" (30)
	- → we need to preserve our culture and faith 
- ...unfortunate how "Uncle Joe" can refer to both [[Stalin]] and [[Joe Biden]] (31)
- "[[Communism]] and Catholicism cannot peacefully coexist" (31)
- [[John Paul II]] understood the priesthood as "a way of life in which he could resist the degradation of human dignity with spiritual and cultural weapons" (33)
- One in every three Polish adults was a spy/listener/informant (36) (!!)
- [[government waste is theft from its citizens]]: "Yet for all the pressure and the intense surveillance (which involved a vast expenditure of state resources, and thus constituted a form of theft from civil society)..."
- [[you must understand the enemy on their terms, not yours]]: ..."Stalin-era Polish communism never quite "got" the Catholic Church. Raw intelligence is only as good as the analysis that filters and explains the data." (37)
- [[Cardinal Wyszyński]] was a master of [[prudence]] and skillfully bought the Church time against the communist regime (38)
	- [[financial independence is a form of resistance against political oppression]], a needed component of [[self-competence]]/[[Emergency Planning]]: "Parents were threatened with loss of employment if they didn't send their children to communist schools and youth groups." (39)
- In his first rural assignment, Fr. [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] visited his five villages by horse cart (not unlike Gandalf in *[[~The Lord of the Rings|The Lord of the Rings]]*)
- Below quotes inspired from [[2021-05-31 Article-In a World Gone Mad, What Would St. John Paul Do?]]
	- "He organized off-campus seminars where students could read [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and the other greats of Catholic intellectual life as an antidote to the Marxists intellectual rubbish to which they were subjected at school." (41)
	- "Fr. Wojtyła created zones of freedom in which the students could live in opposition to the alternative construction of society and the alternative idea of human goods being relentlessly promoted by communist propaganda." (43)
- [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] studied [[Max Scheler]] ([[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach to ethics) for his 2nd doctorate, and concluded that you needed both/and: subjectivity and objective truth (46)
- "The truth about the human person was thus the most powerful weapon of resistance that could be deployed." (47-48)
- A demonstration of the will of the Catholic Polish resistance: they prefabricated their churches at home and then assembled them overnight since the regime denied them building permits (50) (!!)



## Chapter 2: Defensor Civitatis
_Defender of the City, traditional role of the bishop of Krakow_
- [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]]: "This battle runs through the heart of each of us." (55, cf. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in *The Gulag Archipelago*)

- ***Ostpolitik***: [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[Cold War]] diplomacy of "saving what could be saved" (62, 182)
- [[Communist infiltration of the Catholic Church]]: "Nine of the fifteen Hungarian bishops, theologians, and journalists at the [[Vatican II|Council]]'s second session were working for Hungarian intelligence." (64) (!!)
- [[Vatican II divisions aid the Church's enemies]]: "Soviet-bloc intelligence exploited the widening ideological divisions in the Catholic Church for its own purposes." (65)
	- "Polish intelligence...[was] sowing the seeds of discord about the proper interpretation of the [[Vatican II|Council]]'s documents" (66)
- We have Zenon Kliszko to thank for making [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] a bishop! "I'm waiting for Wojtyła and I'll continue to veto names until I get him." (68)
	- Fr. Andrzej Bardecki: "The Holy Spirit can work his will by darkening as well as enlightening people's minds." (70)
- The Sabbath is for us to "rest and rediscover within ourselves the image of the God who had rested on the seventh day." (86)


## Chapter 3: Confrontation
_**Summary**: John Paul II is elected Pope and confronts the communist regime, starting with his pilgrimage back home to Poland._
- [[John Paul II]]: "There are no coincidences: what seems coincidence is actually a facet of God's providence that we don't understand yet." (97)
- "Moscow would prefer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] as Secretary-General of the United Nations than a Pole as Pope." (100)
- Wojtyła's critique of communism in *Person and Act* [[bib]]: totalitarianism's denial of basic human rights is ultimately antihumanism because it diminishes personal moral responsibility (103)
- [[John Paul II]]'s first visit to Poland (June 2–10, 1979) was a turning point in the fight against communism: his theme was living in the truth 
	- he defined [[Solidarity]] as a condition in which personal freedom serves the common good and the community supports individuals as they grow in true maturity
	- it's important to fight *for* something, not simply *against* something (126)

_**Summary**: John Paul II witnesses (and is a key part in) the downfall of communism in Europe._
- "Tools of resistance can be forged from holiness and courage." (162)

_**Summary**: John Paul's experience as a Pole showed the importance of the immersion in anniversaries as a reclamation of the past as a platform from which to launch the future._

## Chapter 6: The Great Jubilee of 2000: Into the Deep
_**Summary**: Evangelization in the great jubilee._
- Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Benjamin of St. Petersburg: "The times have changed and it has become possible to suffer much for love of Christ." (232)

- [ ] #listen to Haydn's *The Creation* (241)
- John Paul II launched a "Mission to the City" in Rome and gave away copies of the Gospel of [[Mark]] (254)
- *Dominus Iesus* [[bib]]: there is no salvation in anyone else but Christ, this does not deny salvation to non-Christians, but points to its ultimate source in Christ, in whom God and man are united (251)



## Chapter 7: The Turbulence of History: 2001-2002
_**Summary**: Duc in altum—Put out into the deep! (cf. [[Lk-05#v4]]) to move beyond institutional maintenance and into the new evangelization._
- [[Phrases to use]]: "new world disorder" (264, 280)

	- he wrote *Roman Triptych* [[bib]] as a way of exploring the path of *beauty* to God 
	- [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] formed his understanding that to lose touch with the beautiful is to lose touch with God himself
	- The recovery of beauty leads to the recovery of authentic humanism 
- [[John Paul II]]'s devotion to the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]: his first question on waking up after being shot was "Have we said Compline yet?" (318)
- The [[Eucharist]] was the center of [[John Paul II]]'s life, and from this came *Ecclesia de Eucharistia* [[bib]] (319)
	- Great discussion of Eucharistic admission on 321+: the Eucharist is apostolic and full communion with the apostolic community of the Church is required for a true and valid Eucharist 
	- "those who receive holy communion are time travelers": the Eucharist takes us out of time into eternity, it unites heaven and earth (322)
- *Ecclesia in Europa* [[bib]] is analysis of the issues of modern secularism in Europe and a call to return to its Christian roots (337)
	- [[having lots of kids]]: Not having children shows something "awry in the realm of the human spirit", a loss of hope in the future (338)
	- Ideas have consequences, and "atheistic humanism" has lethal consequences (cf. *[[2022-10-31-The Drama of Atheist Humanism|The Drama of Atheist Humanism]]* [[bib]]) (338)
	- "It is from the biblical conception of man [that] Europe drew the best of its humanistic culture" (339)
	- "If the Europe of the future were to prosper in a genuinely humane way, it had to be, not simply a free society, but a free and [[Virtues|virtuous]] society—a society in which the moral structure of freedom was well understood, such that European culture and society were safeguarded both from the totalitarian Utopia of freedom without truth which goes hand in hand with a false concept of tolerance." (340)
	- "Europe is not guaranteed a future. Europe must choose to have a future. That would mean choosing to have children. That would mean choosing a firmer foundation for Europe's human rights commitments than pragmatism or utilitarianism." (341)
- *[[~Salvifici Doloris|Salvifici Doloris]]* [[bib]]: "[[Suffering]] seems to be particularly essential to the nature of man" (343)

- [[John Paul II]] published *[[~Memory and Identity|Memory and Identity]]* [[bib]], showing that deficiencies of [[Enlightenment]] theory were one root of the crisis of Western thought and culture. His intellectual project was to put morality on a firmer philosophical base. (375)
	- Critiqued [[Kant|Kantian]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics as insufficient to provide a secure cultural foundation for the exercise of freedom; rather [[Freedom]] is a gift that is to be used to seek what we can know, objectively, to be good (376)
	- [[History]] has a vertical dimension because "it is not only we who write our history—God writes it with us." (377)
- As [[John Paul II]] was dying, Father Styczeń read aloud to him from the Gospel of [[John]] (he had read one chapter a day during his graduate student days in Rome, 385, cf *[[~A Life with Karol|A Life with Karol]]* [[bib]], 257)
- After [[John Paul II]] died, they sang the *[[Te Deum]]* in gratitude for his life (386)

# Part III: A Disciple's Life Explored

## Chapter 10: From Inside
_**Summary**: A view of the life of John Paul II through the lens of the virtues he lived._
- Recall [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s [second inaugural address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln's_second_inaugural_address) [[bib]]
- "[[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] ranks as one of the few men in history who can be called saviors of civilizations as well as of countries" (402)
- [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]]'s life is well captured by the Greek term *metanoia*: conversion (403)
	- "The supernatural is the real" (cf. *Men at Arms* by [[Evelyn Waugh]] [[bib]])
- "[[John Paul II]] lived beyond optimism and pessimism, in a world of Christian realism infused with Christian hope." (408)
- "You can decide because you are capable of understanding the truth." (412)
- [[Fatherhood]]: "[[~The Collected Plays and Writings on Theater#Reflections on Fatherhood|Reflections on Fatherhood]]" in *[[~The Collected Plays and Writings on Theater|The Collected Plays and Writings on Theater]]* by [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] [[bib]] (Berkeley: UC Press, 1987), pg 368 [[bib]] (412)
- "He was a man of disciplined personal habits, who cared little for food (except dessert)" (414)
- [[Bob Dylan]] performed before the Pope spoke at the 1997 Italian National Eucharistic Congress (416)
- [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]]: "The goal of a [[Virtues|virtuous]] life is to become like God." (417)
- Then a reflection on the [[Virtues#Cardinal Virtues]]: 
	- [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] followed [[Aristotle]] in defining the virtue of [[Prudence]] as "right reason in action", it is the "charioteer of the virtues" for applying principle and moral judgment to particular cases and actions (417)
	- [[Justice]] is to give their due to God and neighbor (421)
	- Morris West on [[Fortitude|courage]]: "The man who wore the Fisherman's ring...carried...the sins of the world like a leaden cope on his shoulders." (432, cf. #wishlist *The Devil's Advocate* [[bib]])
	- The [[Temperance|temperate]] man has mastered his passions, found a balance in the use of created goods, and kept desires within the limits of what is honorable (424, cf. *[[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]]* [[bib]])
- [[John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] believed that "the [[Problem of Evil]]...comes into clear focus only by contemplating the face of Christ, the conqueror of evil who reveals the superabundance of God's grace, a grace that can thwart the designs of the Evil One and shake his grip on fragile human souls." (428)
	- [[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]]: "There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an answer to the question of evil." (428)


## Chapter 11: The Measure of a Pontificate
_**Summary**: An evaluation of the accomplishments and shortcomings of John Paul II's pontificate._
- John Paul II's magisterium fills 56 volumes in *Insegnamenti di Giovanni Paolo II* [[bib]] (434)
	- 14 encyclicals
	- 15 apostolic exhortations
	- 12 apostolic constitutions
	- 45 apostolic letters
- Wojtyła was seen in person by more human beings than any man in history (435)
- **Evangelical Papacy**: culture-first approach to the Church's public role
- **[[Vatican II]]**: 
	- it did not provide the keys to its own interpretation, and required full implementation 
	- [[John Paul II]] was the "greatest vocation director the Church has ever had" (444, cf. Cardinal William Baum)
- **1989**: [[John Paul II]] played a critical role in the collapse of communism 
- **Free and Virtuous Society**: requires a democratic process, market economy, and robust public moral culture (451)
- **Ecumenical Imperative**: doctrine of justification was no longer a dividing issue 
- **Culture of life**: democracy can only sustain itself over time if it is built on a culture of life (465)
- **Christian [[Feminism]]**: the "feminine genius" as told in *Redemptoris Mater* and *Mulieris Dignitatem* [[bib]] (471)
- [[Joseph Ratzinger|Ratzinger]]: "*Redemptor Hominis* [[bib]] is really a synthesis of [[John Paul II]]'s thinking" (548
- [[John Paul II]] "trusted his own instincts because those instincts had been refined by prayer" (481)
- Themes (481):

>The understanding of the third millennium as a privileged moment of grace in which the Church could reexperience itself as a communion of disciples called to a new evangelization of the world; the personalist Christology according to which Jesus Christ reveals both the face of the merciful Father and the truth about our humanity; the notion of a Law of the Gift, built into the structure of moral choice and action, as the royal road to human fulfillment; solidarity as the key to living freedom nobly in free and virtuous societies; the revelatory iconography of our embodied ness and complementarity as male and female—these signature themes of the pontificate reflected a uniquely Wojtylan synthesis of Catholic thought and practice, and a crucial set of keys for interpreting the event at which the twentieth-century Catholic renewal reached its dramatic watershed, the Second Vatican Council.

- [[John Paul II]]'s pontificate was not without its failures:
	- Magisterium ill-received in Germany, as it is today (485)
	- ecumenical frustrations and the reality of history (490)
	- over-reading of the importance of 1989 (493)
	- liturgical abuses (498)
	- administrative challenges (501)
- [[John Paul II]] recognized the need to [[positively state the good rather than actively getting bogged down in refutation]]: "[[John Paul II]] chose to affirm and support what was growing and healthy in the Church, leaving dissent to die of its own implausibility." (510)
