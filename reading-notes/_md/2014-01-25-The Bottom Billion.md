# The Bottom Billion by Paul Collier

* The Traps
    * Conflict
    * Natural resources
        * Dutch disease – resource exports cause currency to rise in value, making export activities uncompetitive when those activities may be desired for development
    * Landlocked with bad neighbors
        * Increase neighborhood growth spillovers
        * Improve neighbors’ economic policies
        * Improve costal access
        * Become a haven for the region
        * Don’t be air-locked or e-locked
        * Encourage remittances
        * Transparent and investor-friendly environment for resources prospecting
        * Rural development
        * Try to attract aid
    * Bad governance in a small country
* The Instruments
    * Aid
    * Military – serves four purposes
        * Expelling an aggressor
        * Restoration of order
        * Maintaining post-conflict peace
        * Preventing coups
* Laws and Charters
    * Our (developed nations’) laws often affect problems in bottom billion countries
    * Charter for natural resource revenues
    * Charter for democracy
    * Charter for budget transparency
    * Charter for postconflict situations
    * Charter for investment
* Agenda for Action
    * “But do not think that just because your work is unconnected with development you are off the hook.  You are a citizen, and citizenship carries responsibilities” (175-176).
    * “The key obstacle to reforming aid is public opinion.  The constituency for aid is suspicious of growth, and the constituency for growth is suspicious of aid” (183).
    * Collier’s three central propositions (192)
    * The development problem is new, and is tightly focused on the Bottom Billion
    * The politics of the Bottom Billion is a “dangerous contest between moral extremes” – the main struggle comes from within those societies
    * “We do not need to be bystanders” – Collier lays out his proposed interventions in the book
