- "I am fairly pleased with my devotional practices which bring me near to God. After having skimmed through the doctrine of various authors, I am now quite content with the Missal, the Breviary, the Bible, *[[~The Imitation of Christ|The Imitation]]* and Bossuet's *Méditations sur l'Evangile*. The holy liturgy and Sacred Scripture give me very rich pasture for my soul. So I am simplifying everything more and more and find it is better so. But I want to give more faithful and devout attention to the holy Eucharist..." (267)
- "I desire and think of nothing else but to live and die for the souls entrusted to me." (282, cf. [[Jn-10#v11]])
