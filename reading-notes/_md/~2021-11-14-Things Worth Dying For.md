## Chapter 1: If I Forget Thee, O Jerusalem
**Summary**: Asking ourselves what is worth dying for helps us clarify what is worth living for.
- "Mouthing lies we know to be lies murders us inwardly." (cf [[2021-07-15-"Live Not by Lies"]], *[[2021-10-30-Live Not By Lies]]*)
- Martyrdom: "Those who are faithful to God will in turn have his faithfulness at life's ending, no matter how extreme the test." (16)
- Asking ourselves what is worth dying for helps us clarify what is worth living for (17)
- "My thoughts these days often turn tothe author and scholar [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The drama of the Christian story shaped everything Tolkien wrote; the intensity of his Catholic faith grounded his entire life and genius."
	- *[[~The Two Towers#^5b350d]]*


## Chapter 2: Gentle, Into That Good Night
**Summary**: (how we should think about death and the verdict it passes on the lives we live)
- We are "subcreators" (cf [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]), and what we build shows what we care about (temples and tombs vs skyscrapers)
- [[Joseph Ratzinger]] in *Introduction to Christianity*: "Meaning that is self-made is, in the last analysis, no meaning. Meaning cannot be made but only received." (29)
- "How a culture deals with death reveals how it thinks about the meaning of life and the nature of the human person...[Death] can sharpen our awareness of beauty and intensify our loves." (31)
- [[Ecclesiastes]] shows us what life looks like without hope in the resurrection
