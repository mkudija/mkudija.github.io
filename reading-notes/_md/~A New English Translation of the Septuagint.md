### To The Reader of NETS
- The Septuagint is "hardly Greek at all, but rather Hebrew in disguise" (xiv)
- "Since NETS was to echo the original dependent relationship of the Greek upon the Hebrew, one could seemingly do no better than to base NETS on an existing English translation of the Hebrew [NRSV] and to modify that base as dictated by the Greek." (xv)
- "What the Septuagint says, and how it says it, can only be understood in its entirety with the help of the Hebrew" (xv)
- Chose to base NETS off the NRSV because of "general compatibility of translational approach with that of the LXX itself", and because of the NRSV's widespread use (xv)
- NETS deviates from NRSV when (xvi)
	- lexical choice differs 
	- hyper-literalistic vs free 
	- linguistic features of the Greek 
	- textual difference vs the MT 
	- gender [[Inclusive-Language Translations|inclusive language]] (eschewed by NETS)
	- NRSV failing to translate MT 
- "The Committee's desire to enable the reader to make use of NETS in synoptic manner with the NRSV has been second only to its commitment to giving a faithful rendering of the Greek original." (xvi)
- "Translating an ancient text can only be described as a profoundly difficult undertaking...It is an act of hubris." (xvi)
- "If translating is an act of interpreting, a Greek interpretation of a Hebrew original can be expected to reflect what the translator understood the Hebrew text to mean. The end result is therefore inevitably to some degree a commentary written at a specific historical time and place by and individual person." (xvi)
- NETS lexical guidelines to determine what the Greek means (xvii)
	- Greek words in the LXX normally mean what they mean in the greek of that period (majority)
	- Nuance of Greek words is sometimes arbitrated by the Hebrew parent text 
	- Stereotypes: some Greek words translated as above fit poorly in context
	- Isolates: some selected because of their connection with a Hebrew morpheme
	- Calques: some Greek words in the LXX have Hebrew meanings
- The Septuagint is paradigmatically an interlinear translation of the Hebrew, there is a wide diversity within the books as to how literal they are, and some ([[2 Maccabees]], [[Wisdom]]) were composed in Greek (xviii)
- Being interlinear, it is not beautiful literature in either Greek or English (xviii)
- "NETS is more a translation of formal correspondence than one of dynamic equivalence" (xviii)
- For commentary, see the Society of Biblical Literature Commentary on the Septuagint (SBLCS)
