### To The Reader of NETS
- The Septuagint is "hardly Greek at all, but rather Hebrew in disguise" (xiv)
- "Since NETS was to echo the original dependent relationship of the Greek upon the Hebrew, one could seemingly do no better than to base NETS on an existing English translation of the Hebrew [NRSV] and to modify that base as dictated by the Greek." (xv)
- "What the Septuagint says, and how it says it, can only be understood in its entirety with the help of the Hebrew" (xv)
- Chose to base NETS off the NRSV because of "general compatibility of translational approach with that of the LXX itself", and because of the NRSV's widespread use (xv)
- NETS deviates from NRSV when (xvi)
	- lexical choice differs 
	- hyper-literalistic vs free 
	- linguistic features of the Greek 
	- textual difference vs the MT 
	- gender [[Inclusive-Language Translations|inclusive language]] (eschewed by NETS)
	- NRSV failing to translate MT 
- "The Committee's desire to enable the reader to make use of NETS in synoptic manner wit hthe NRSV has been second only to its commitment to giving a faithful rendering of the Greek original." (xvi)
