### To The Reader of NETS
- The Septuagint is "hardly Greek at all, but rather Hebrew in disguise" (xiv)
- "Since NETS was to echo the original dependent relationship of the Greek upon the Hebrew, one could seemingly do no better than to base NETS on an existing English translation of the Hebrew [NRSV] and to modify that base as dictated by the Greek." (xv)
- "What the Septuagint says, and how it says it, can only be understood in its entirety with the help of the Hebrew" (xv)
