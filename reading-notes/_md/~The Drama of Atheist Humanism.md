##  Foreword
*by [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]*

## Preface 

# Part One: Atheistic Humanism
## Chapter 1: [[Feuerbach]] and [[Nietzsche]]
_**Summary**: _

### 1. A Tragic Misunderstanding
*Christianity puts forth a radical (to the ancients) view of man: both low in his fallenness and great in his redemption. But this liberation eventually started to feel like a yoke, leading to the atheism (really anti-theism) of absolute humanism.*

### 2. [[Feuerbach]] and the Religious Illusion
*[[Feuerbach]] is the link from [[Hegel]] to [[Marx]]. For him God is only the sum of the attributes of the greatness of man, and is then cast off. His goal is to reveal man's essence to give him faith in himself. [[Marx]] then takes the religious ideas of Feuerback and applies them to the social and political order, which has no God because it seeks to restore divinity to man.*

### 3. [[Nietzsche]] and the "Death of God"
*[[Nietzsche]] proclaimed the death of God as an act of the will—a murder—that urges man to greatness.*
