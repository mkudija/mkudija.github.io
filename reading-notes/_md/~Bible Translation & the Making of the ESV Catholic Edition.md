main benefits of ESV: 
- The ESV is a consciously Christian translation by reading OT/NT in continuity (10), and very consistent in its treatment on inclusive language (11)
- Ecumenical (11)
- KJV/RSV heritage

# Part I: Origins

## Chapter 1: Why Another Translation?
_**Summary**: Desire in the 1990s for new translations like the ESV grew out of frustrations with with available options, often pushing the the extreme on one side or the other._

- *The Language of the King James Bible: A Glossary Explaining Its Words and Expressions* by Melvin E. Elliott [[bib]] (4)
- Two extremes of dynamic equivalence vs formal equivalence: The NIV is very readable but not as accurate to the text as one might like; the NASB took literalism to is most extreme, maintaining a single word from the original (cf. *[[~The Art of Bible Translation#Chapter 1: The Eclipse of Bible Translation]]*) but being less readable (5)
- Additionally, given that the RSV had gone out of print and the NRSV was criticized for going to o far on inclusive language, by the 1990s many thought there was need for a new translation (7)
- The guidelines of *[[2022-11-15-Liturgiam authenticam|Liturgiam authenticam]]* in many ways overlap with the philosophy of the ESV translators (9)
- The ESV is a consciously Christian translation by reading OT/NT in continuity (10), and very consistent in its treatment on inclusive language (11)
- "Learning the original languages of Scriptureâ€”Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaicâ€”is the only way to gain access to the meaning contained in them without a translator's involvement. One Jewish poet, Hayim Naham Bialik, is purported to have said: 'Reading the Bible in translation is like kissing your new bride through a veil.'" (12)


## Chapter 2: The Catholic Lectionary Problem
_**Summary**: English-speaking Catholics have many translations to choose from, but an unfortunate lack of unity as a result._

- The Douay-Rheims was the gold standard for Catholic Bible translations, and with the revisions in the direction of the KVJ by Bishop Richard Challoner can be thought of a KJV twin. But also note that it was translated in a hurry from the Vulgate rather than the original languages (14, cf. *The Part of Rheims in the Making of the English Bible* by James G. Carleton [[bib]])
- The Catholic Biblical Association of America (CBA) revised DR to the Confraternity in 1941 (still from Vulgate), but then *[[~Divino Afflante Spiritu|Divino Afflante Spiritu]]* in 1943 specified original languages, so they started the New American Bible (16)
	- The NABRE shows how "Bible translations are not unchanging monoliths, but open-ended results of complex processes of ongoing revision." (17)
	- NABRE changes verse and chapter numbers (in [[Joel]] and [[Malachi]] for example)
	- [[Fr. Richard John Neuhaus]] called the NAB "clunky" and "unfortunate" ([Three Who Changed the World](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/02/three-who-changed-the-world))
- The Jerusalem Bible has similar problems as the NIV and NABRE (though interesting that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] contributed to it, 20)
- Sad reality: "English-speaking Catholics around the globe have little unity in the way they hear, pray, sing, study, and meditate on Scripture...With such a diversity in translation, the words typically feel less important, less sacred, and less powerful than they would in a more unified environment." (22)
