## Preface 
- "There is always a need - especially now in the third millennium, when such deep shadows loom across the modern world—to return *ad fontes*, to drink from these pure papal streams, and not to allow mountains of secondary literature, most of it superficial or agenda-driven or both, to stand between us and the wisdom of the Church's magisterium." (i)
- "The subject matter of CST is nothing less than the totality of man's social life, in all its dimensions—domestic, political, cultural, and, of course, economic." (ii)
- "I would encourage serious students of the Church's magisterium to get used to looking at important passages *in the Latin text* transmitted by publications of the Apostolic See. This is the *only* official text, the one that is promulgated and authoritative." (iii-iv)
- "A word should be said about why certain documents are not found in this collection. My general policy was to select classic texts that articulate principles with great clarity and relative succinctness. Some later documents, such as those of [[Vatican II]], tend to lack this clarity and succinctness. Moreover, recent materials tend to be better known than the classic sources to which they continually refer. For example, the content of *[[~Gaudium et Spes|Gaudium et spes]]* is largely a résumé and synthesis of the magisterium of Pius XII and John XXIII, while its most fruitful ideas were taken up and better developed by John Paul II. In like manner, the content of the Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity *[[~Apostolicam actuositatem|Apostolicam Actuositatem]]* is not altogether novel but was anticipated in earlier papal encyclicals, most strikingly in Leo XIII's *Sapientiae Christianae* and in Pius XI's exhortations of the 1920s and 1930s. Hence, for the student who wants to enter most deeply into Vatican Ils contribution to CST, there is no better way than to study the Council's roots in the magisterium of the preconciliar popes as well as the Council's reception and development in the magisterium of the postconciliar popes." (iv)
- "*[[~Dignitatis humanae|Dignitatis humanae]]* raises more questions than it answers." See the debate between Martin Rhonheimer and Thomas Pink to learn more. This edition uses the translation by Dr. [[Michael Pakaluk]]. (iv)
