# Originals by Adam Grant

* Donâ€™t settle for the default settings in your life
* To create great things, you need to create a lot of things so that greatness is included in the variability
* Risk: mitigate risk and take measured risk (as opposed to the classic view of entrepreneurs taking daring risks)
* Disarm your critics by starting your explanation with the weaknesses of your proposal. It will throw them off guard and give you credibility when you then explain all the strengths
* Strategic procrastination: waiting until you are really ready to make an impact
