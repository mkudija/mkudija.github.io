>Love for the Lord, then, is one with love for the poor...In the poor, he continues to speak to us. (5)

> The poor cannot be neglected if we are to remain within the great current of the Church’s life that has its source in the Gospel and bears fruit in every time and place. (15)

- *Dilexi te*: “I have loved you” ([[Rv-03#v9]]) (1)
- [[Pope Francis]] was preparing in the last months of his life an Apostolic Exhortation on the Church’s care for the poor. I am happy to make this document my own — adding some reflections — and to issue it at the beginning of my own pontificate, since I share the desire of my beloved predecessor that all Christians come to appreciate the close connection between Christ’s love and his summons to care for the poor. I too consider it essential to insist on this path to holiness... (3)

### **CHAPTER ONE: A FEW ESSENTIAL WORDS**
- No sign of affection, even the smallest, will ever be forgotten, especially if it is shown to those who are suffering, lonely or in need. (4)
- Love for the Lord, then, is one with love for the poor...In the poor, he continues to speak to us. (5)
- I am convinced that the preferential choice for the poor is a source of extraordinary renewal both for the Church and for society, if we can only set ourselves free of our self-centeredness and open our ears to their cry. (7)
- A concrete commitment to the poor must also be accompanied by a change in mentality that can have an impact at the cultural level. In fact, the illusion of happiness derived from a comfortable life pushes many people towards a vision of life centered on the accumulation of wealth and social success at all costs, even at the expense of others and by taking advantage of unjust social ideals and political-economic systems that favor the strongest. (11)
- The poor cannot be neglected if we are to remain within the great current of the Church’s life that has its source in the Gospel and bears fruit in every time and place. (15)
