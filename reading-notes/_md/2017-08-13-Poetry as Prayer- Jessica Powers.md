# Poetry as Prayer: Jessica Powers by Robert F. Morneau

* Ten steps to reading poetry in a holy way
    * Invoke the Holy Spirit
    * Read aloud in multiple readings
    * “Videotape” as you read - visualize what is happening in your mind
    * Find a poetry companion
    * Trust your body - feel the deep ache
    * Read actively
    * Create an atmosphere, your poetry corner
    * Read poetry at high-energy times
    * Memorize
    * Keep a poetry journal
