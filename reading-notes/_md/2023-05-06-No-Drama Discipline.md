The concepts from these authors here and in *[[~The Whole-Brain Child|The Whole-Brain Child]]* have been helpful for me and Jordan with the kids. I listened to part of this, but ended up flipping through the rest because of the helpful cartoons with example dialogue, and well-organized headings and italics to emphasize main points. Some key takeaways:
- two goals: encouraging cooperation and building the brain 
- focus on the relationship  
- connect and redirect  
- be intentional

## Introduction 
*Rational, low-drama discipline: encouraging cooperation while building a child's brain*
- The word *Discipline* is about teaching and skill-building
- Two goals of no-drama discipline:
	- 1. **Encouraging cooperation**: Stopping bad behavior and promoting good behavior 
	- 2. **Building the brain**: Teaching skills and nurturing the connections in our children's brains that will help them make better decisions and handle themselves well in the future 
- Consequences and punitive reactions are often *counterproductive* to both the short and long term goals 
- Foundation of no-drama discipline: **Connect and redirect** (our relationship with our children should be central)
- Reference: *[[~The Whole-Brain Child|The Whole-Brain Child]]* [[bib]]
- â†’though: parent our children the way the Lord parented Israel in the Old Testament: patiently and focusing on the relationship 

## Chapter 1: ReTHINKING Discipline
_**Summary**: We're not perfect but should try to approach discipline with an intentional philosophy._
- Ask three questions before responding to misbehavior: 
	1. *Why did my child act this way?*
	2. *What lesson do I want to teach at this moment?*
	3. *How can I best teach this lesson?*
- *Can't* vs *Won't* behave: our capacity to behave well fluctuates based on a number of factors (sleep, stress, etc.): we need to account for these in understanding why our children are acting the way they are
- Don't spank and don't put kids in time-out (gives some research: avoid the brain disconnect from wanting the parent to comfort but also wanting to flee from pain)
- We need to show our kids that we always love them, even when they are not behaving well 


## Chapter 2: Your Brian on Discipline 
_**Summary**: _
- The Brain is *Changing*, *Changeable*, *Complex*
- We need to help develop our children's upstairs brain
- Repeated experiences change the physical architecture of the brain, and it is paramount that we be intention about the experiences we give our children 
- No Drama Discipline: communicate to your child that you love them even when they are at their worst: The way we interact with our kids when they're upset significantly affects how their brains develop, and therefore what kind of people they are
- Instead of an outright "no", try a "yes" with a condition 


## Chapter 3: From Tantrum to Tranquility: Connection Is the Key
_**Summary**: _
- See bad behaviors developing and head them off 
- Connect first: 
	- Connection moves a child from reactivity to receptivity 
	- Connection builds the brain 
	- Connection deepens the relationship with the child 
- An upset child is suffering, and needs us to be there for them 
- Kids need us to set boundaries and communicate our expectations, but the key is that all discipline should begin by nurturing our children 
- When your child is at his worst, that's when he needs you the most 


## Chapter 4: No-Drama Connection in Action
_**Summary**: _
- Connection principles:
	- #1: Turn down the shark music and connect with your child 
	- #2: Chase the why 
	- #3: Think about the how 
- Connection strategies:
	- #1: Communicate comfort 
	- #2: Validate, Validate, Validate 
	- #3: Stop talking and listen 
	- #4: Reflect on what you hear 


## Chapter 5: 1-2-3 Discipline: Redirecting for Today, and for Tomorrow
_**Summary**: _
- #1: Wait until your child is ready 
- #2: Be consistent, not rigid 


## Chapter 6: Addressing Behavior: As Simple as R-E-D-I-R-E-C-T
_**Summary**: _
- How your respond to your child's behavior will greatly impact how the whole scene unfolds
- REDIRECT 
	- Reduce words 
	- Embrace emotions 
	- Describe, don't preach 
	- Involve your child in the discipline 
	- Reframe a no into a conditional yes 
	- Emphasize the positive 
	- Creatively approach the situation 
	- Teach mindsight tools 
- Great cartoon to teach your kids about the upstairs and downstairs brain on pg 205


## Conclusion: On Magic Wands, Being Human, Reconnection, and Change: Four Messages of Hope
_**Summary**: _
- There's no magic wand 
- Your kids benefit even when you mess up 
- You can always reconnect 
- It's never too late to make a positive change
