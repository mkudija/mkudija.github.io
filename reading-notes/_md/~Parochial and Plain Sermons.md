### The Religion of the Day
*pg 196*
- "In every age of Christianity, since it was first preached, there has been what may be called a *religion of the world*, which so far imitates the one true religion, as to deceive the unstable and unwary. The world does not oppose religion *as such*. I may say, it never has opposed it. In particular, it has, in all ages, acknowledged in one sense or other the Gospel of Christ, **fastened on one or other of its characteristics, and professed to embody this in its practice; while by neglecting the other parts of the holy doctrine, it has, in fact, distorted and corrupted even that portion of it which it has exclusively put forward**, and so has contrived to explain away the whole;—for **he who cultivates only one precept of the Gospel to the exclusion of the rest, in reality attends to no part at all. Our duties *balance* each other**; and though we are too sinful to perform them all perfectly, yet we may in some measure be performing them all, and preserving the balance on the whole; whereas, to give ourselves only to this or that commandment, is to incline our minds in a wrong direction, and at length to pull them down to the earth, which is the aim of our adversary, the Devil."
- "Half the truth is often the most gross and mischievous of falsehoods."
- What is the world's religion now [in 1834]?
	- "we avoid giving pain or offense; our words become correct"
	- "Every thing is bright and cheerful. **Religion is pleasant and easy; benevolence is the chief virtue; intolerance, bigotry, excess of zeal, are the first of sins. Austerity is an absurdity;—even firmness is looked on with an unfriendly, suspicious eye**...Religion will commonly seem to be dull, from want of novelty...The mind becomes dissatisfied with tings as they are, desirous of a change *as such.*" (i.e. [[Moralistic Therapeutic Deism]])
- The solution is a "deep resignation to God's will, a surrender of ourselves"
