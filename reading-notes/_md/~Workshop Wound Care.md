**Chapter 1: Introduction**

This will be a practical guide for triaging and managing wounds in a wood shop. Along the way you’ll learn a bit about anatomy, wound healing and the pathophysiology of certain types of wounds, in addition to learning how to stop bleeding, dress wounds, and, heaven forbid, store and transport an amputated finger tip for possible re-implantation.

**Chapter 2: Building out a Proper First Aid Kit**

Standard first aid kits that you buy over the counter contain some useful items but usually not in proper quantities or of proper quality. Collecting select high quality equipment will ultimately be more functional.

**Chapter 3: How to Stop Bleeding**

Staunching the flow of blood from an open wound is of nearly obvious importance but it is often done wrong. Here we will walk through the approach to stopping bleeding from various type of wounds

**Chapter 4: Wound Healing Primer**

The pathophysiology of wound healing is a series of biochemical cascades; understanding (in plain language) what is happening at a cellular level can give additional insight into expectations of the wound healing process.

**Chapter 5: Anatomy Primer**

Understanding the anatomy of frequently injured parts of the body can help on triage the seriousness of a particular wound. We’ll cover the anatomy of the hand and face primarily.

**Chapter 6: Red Flags**

Judging exactly when to seek care after an injury is very much situation-dependent, however there are certain things which will absolutely necessitate addition care by a medical provider (loss of function, neuromuscular compromise, wound healing, cosmetic concerns).

**Chapter 7: Tetanus is a Bad Way to Die**

This chapter will cover the risks of tetanus based on exposure type and immunization status with a brief primer on what tetanus is and how infections occur.

**Chapter 8: Early Wound Care Principles**

Appropriate early wound care and proper irrigation, in particular, is important for decreasing the risk of infection. We’ll focus on irrigation techniques with a focus on those that have the best evidence for preventing wound infections.

**Chapter 9: Wound Dressings**

If a cut/abrasion can be dealt with in the shop, or if a wound has been dealt with at a doctor’s office, an understanding of how to appropriately dress the wound to ensure a clean, not overly moist healing environment. We focus on care of sutured, taped, and glued wounds and focus on bandaging techniques that will lead to secure(ish) dressings.

**Chapter 10: So You Cut Your ____ Off? Now What?**

This chapter will give clear instructions on how to properly store an amputated piece of your body for possible reattachment. It will also cover the immediate care, and common treatment, of amputations.

**Chapter 11: Lacerations**

Among the most commonly encountered injuries, the initial care and triage of lacerations depends on the nature of the wound and what caused the tissue injury. Clean cuts from knives and chisels will generally be easier to manage than tissue-loss injuries caused by power tools. 

**Chapter 12: Crush Injuries**

A misplaced blow of a hammer or dropped workpiece will crush tissues and possibly break bones. We’ll cover the general triage and pathophysiology of these injuries with special focus on subungal hematoma (bleeding/bruising under nails).

**Chapter 13: Puncture Wounds**

Puncture wounds may appear innocuous but pose the greatest risk in terms of wound infection. The triage of the wounds generally revolves around the site of injury, what caused the puncture, the cleanliness of your skin (and the object that punctured you). Splinter management is covered in this chapter.

**Chapter 14: High-pressure Injection Injuries**

These are a type of puncture wound where the puncturing object is the air and whatever was being sprayed. These injuries can seem relatively minor at first however they can be incredibly devastating with extensive tissue loss from necrosis that develops in hours and days.

**Chapter 15: Eye Injuries**

The eye deserves special attention as there is risk of permanent vision loss with some types of injuries. This chapter gives consideration to corneal abrasions, metal and organic foreign bodies, and puncture wounds/open globes.
