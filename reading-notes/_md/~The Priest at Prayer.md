### [[Mental Prayer]]
- c.f. Chapter 8 of the *[[~Autobiography of St. Teresa of Ávila|Autobiography of St. Teresa of Ávila]]*: 15 min of mental prayer every day (172)


### [[Liturgy of the Hours|The Breviary]]
- "The [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] is radically and substantially of Divine Law; it is of the pith and marrow of our priesthood, of priesthood in general; for, as the Epistle to the Hebrews expresses it, 'Every high priest is taken from among men and made their representative before God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. ' ([[Heb-05#v1]])" (179)
- "**What spiritual treasures would be mine if I said the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] properly!** Treasures of the mind, treasures of the heart, imperishable treasures of the soul." (181)
- "**I should be steeping my spirit in the ever-fresh aroma of those old prayers of the Church**, the only prayers worthy of God; of those [[Psalms]] wherein the Divine Spirit pleads with unutterable groans and longings through the voice of all creatures visible and invisible, a pleading that runs through the whole scale of human love, feeling, and mysterious yearning." (181)
- "Delve into the hidden treasures amassed in the liturgical books, in the [[~Roman Missal|Missal]], Ritual, [[Liturgy of the Hours|Breviary]], etc.; **books where one can learn the language that is pleasing to God**, books abounding in sovereign beauty, enough to enrich many a literature; **books that in sheer grace of style, depth of feeling, boldness and sublimity of thought, surpass the greatest literatures**, either popular or classical." (181-182) ^13a81d
- "In my spare moments—and who hasn't them?—I propose to study the [[Liturgy of the Hours|breviary]]: the psalter and the prayers added by the Church. Could I honestly say that I ever spent so much as half an hour in such profitable study?" (182-183)
