## Introduction
- "A central theme through all three books is that human civilizational progress is inextricably linked with the hardness of our money: the harder the money is to make, the less its supply will increase over time, the better it will hold its value, and the more it will allow its holder to provide for the future more effectively, decreasing the uncertainty surrounding the future, and causing us to discount the future less. In other words, hard money makes us more future-oriented, lowering our time preference, which is what initiates the process of civilization."
- "The collapse of society witnessed under hyperinflation is just a faster and more noticeable version of the same process slow fiat inflation brings about."
- "Pervading all three of my books is a deep sense of historical regret over a world that could have been..."
- *[[~Gold Wars|Gold Wars]]*: "This was one of the most influential books I’ve read in my life. It explained the history of the gold standard and its almost mystical positive influence over human society in a remarkably clear manner. That book, more than any other, was the driving influence behind me writing _The Bitcoin Standard_ and it inspired many of the critical ideas in it. If I were to apply the ideas of _The Bitcoin Standard_ to the historical gold standard, I could scarcely improve upon Lips’ masterpiece, which I very strongly recommend reading." Also read *[[~Gold and the Gold Standard|Gold and the Gold Standard]]*.
- "There were many imperfections in the gold standard in the nineteenth century. Even at its best it fell short of the ideal form of a gold standard in which all financial instruments are backed by 100% of their face value in gold in the vaults of the issuer...What would happen if we had a perfect gold standard?...This question, along with the question of what the twentieth century would have looked like on hard money, inspired the writing of _The Gold Standard_."
- "_The Gold Standard_ attempts to answer these questions with a fictional economic history of an alternative twentieth century in which the fiat money experiment fails in 1915."
- "This is an Austrian economists’ work of entrepreneurial fiction."
- "The years 1914-15 were of extraordinary historical importance, as they gave birth to the monetary system and world order in which we live today. By introducing developments that are not entirely outlandish to the aviation industry, this book derails the fiat money experiment in its infancy and strangles the fiat century in its crib."
