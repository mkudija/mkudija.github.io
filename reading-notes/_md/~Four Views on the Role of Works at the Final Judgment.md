[James Dunn and Michael Barber on "The Role ofâ€¦ | Zondervan Academic](https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/dunn-and-barber-on-the-role-of-works-at-the-final-judgement)
Barber's argument:
1. salvation is first by God's grace and not by works
2. one receives Christ not because one has performed good works
3. once one has become united with Christ, one is capable of doing what was previously impossible, mainly performing the required good works, being perfect
4. works performed by those in union with Christ have meritorious value, because through Christ's own meritorious capacity believers are able to merit salvation in him
