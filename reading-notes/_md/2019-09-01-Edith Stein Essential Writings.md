Somehow reading Edith Stein feels like I'm reading someone much *older* than her, perhaps St. Theresa of √Åvila who she looked up to so much.

- "Be patient with yourself; God is." (11)
- "One can find God *in* the world by bringing God *to* the world." (23)
- "Our love for our brothers and sisters is the measure of our love for God." (42)
- "The work of salvation takes place in obscurity and stillness." (55)
- "As the atmosphere around us grows steadily darker, all the more must we open our hearts to the light from above." (59)
- "From God's point of view nothing is accidental." (71)
- "God is truth. All who seek truth seek God." (91)
- "A fine home creates an atmosphere in which the sould can freely breathe." (103)
- "God wants your life in order to give you his." (133)
- "Only one who possesses nothing possesses everything." (142)
