## Some Themes and Take-aways
- Give the Lord your firstfruits, especially the firstfruits of your time 
- "You shall be my people and I shall be your God"
- We are always tempted to idolatry (usually making good things ultimate things) 
- Be faithful to the Lord, always

## Progress

Just for fun, the chart below shows my progress in 2022. I started listening to the Bible in a Year podcast late in February (see [Inspiration for "Bible in a Year"](#inspiration-for-bible-in-a-year)), so I was already 35 days behind. The straight segments are stretches of not listening, which were especially bad from May to July. I kicked it into high gear in October to finish by the the end of the year.

# Notes 

## Early World
- Turquoise for the earth from space
- Genesis 1-11: Hebrew poetry

**Day 1**: [[2022-02-05-Sat]] - [[Gn-01]], [[Gn-02]], [[Ps-19]]
- all of human rights is founded in Genesis 1, God created the world out of love rather than violence and domination

**Day 2**: [[2022-02-06-Sun]] - [[Gn-03]], [[Gn-04]], [[Ps-104]]
- Cain and Abel: **give God your first fruits**, i.e. our [[Prayer]]/[[Spiritual Disciplines]] should be at the best time of your day

**Day 3**: [[2022-02-07-Mon]] - [[Gn-05]], [[Gn-06]], [[Ps-136]]
- Cain's line (daughters of men) and Seth's line (son's of God) split
	- Seth walks in the way of the Lord but Cain did not  
	- Seth's line is in God's image and likeness, but not Cain's line which produces murders and polygamists
	- from *Walking with God* book 
- Marrying someone determines so much of the trajectory of your life, and their intermarrying had huge consequences  
- **Even if the culture around us is broken, we can still walk with God like Noah did**

**Day 4**: [[2022-02-07-Mon]] - [[Gn-07]], [[Gn-08]], [[Gn-09]], [[Ps-01]]
- "The covenant between God and mankind is interwoven with reminders of God's gift of human life and man's murderous violence" ([[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 2260)
- Ham sings against Noah by laying with his wife (an act of domination over him), leading to the breaking of that family ([[Gn-09#v22]]): families are consistently broken

**Day 5**: [[2022-02-07-Mon]] - [[Gn-10]], [[Gn-11]], [[Ps-02]]
- Pursue excellence, not for our own sake (Tower of Babel) but for God (like [[St. Maximilian Kolbe]] who's prayer before ordination was to be a saint, and a *great* saint)
	- [[St. Francis de Sales]]: "be who you are, and be that well"


## The Patriarchs
- Burgundy for blood
- Genesis 12-50
- Toledote (sp?) is the Hebrew literary mechanism to zoom in from the big picture to an individual person as demonstrated in the biblical genealogies 
- The brokenness of the Bible reflects the brokenness in our lives
- The Hebrew writers don't always *tell* you what happens or what the consequences are, but *shows* us, so we need to look for patterns
- Letter to you individually, Fulfillment in Heaven 
- [[Prayer of St. Ephraim]]: take in what we can and don't be overwhelmed!
- Listen to scripture: "faith comes by hearing" ([[Rom-10#v17]])

**Day 6**: [[2022-02-08-Tue]] - [[Gn-12]], [[Gn-13]], [[Jb-01]], [[Jb-02]], [[Prv-01]]
- Even Abram, the father of faith, is broken (shown here in passing off his wife as his sister so Pharaoh can take her as his wife)
- [[Gn-13#v9]]: But Abram shows his faithfulness in taking the opposite of whatever land Lot wants so there is no strife between them, trusting in the Lord to provide  
- [[Jb-01#v20]]-[[Jb-01#v21]]: Job's first response to suffering is to worship the Lord

**Day 7**: [[2022-02-08-Tue]] - [[Gn-14]], [[Gn-15]], [[Jb-03]], [[Jb-04]], [[Prv-01]]
- [[Gn-14#v18]]: Melchizedek the priest offers sacrifice of bread and wine, prefiguring Christ 
- God passed though the pieces of dead animals (signifying the covenant) even though Abram did not: he is taking our failings on him as he did in the person of Jesus

**Day 8**: [[2022-02-09-Wed]] - [[Gn-16]], [[Gn-17]], [[Jb-05]], [[Jb-06]], [[Prv-01]]
- Circumcision is the sign of surrender to the Lord God  
- Job just wants God to be with him in his suffering  

**Day 9**: [[2022-02-09-Wed]] - [[Gn-18]], [[Gn-19]], [[Jb-07]], [[Jb-08]], [[Prv-02]]
- [[Gn-19#v32]]: The story of Lot’s daughters getting him drunk and then lying with him to beget offspring: the Bible tends to *show* us something is wrong rather than *telling* us, here in the degeneracy of the Moabites and Ammonites

**Day 10**: [[2022-02-10-Thu]] - [[Gn-20]], [[Gn-21]], [[Jb-09]], [[Jb-10]], [[Prv-02]]
- [[Gn-20]]: Abraham again tried to pass off Sarah as merely his sister, but God came to Abimelech in a dream and thus preserved him from sin. How many times does God protect us from sin without our even knowing it?
- And yet sometimes he allows us to fail to teach us to trust him and so we can learn what it is to be loved even when we fail.

**Day 11**: [[2022-02-11-Fri]] - [[Gn-22]], [[Gn-23]], [[Jb-11]], [[Jb-12]], [[Prv-02]]
- Isaac cooperated with his father in the sacrifice, just as Christ did in his sacrifice. This is a story about how the father and son cooperate together to bring about salvation.  
- Abraham is the father of faith because when it came down to it he was willing to *trust* God.

**Day 12**: [[2022-02-12-Sat]] - [[Gn-24]], [[Jb-13]], [[Jb-14]], [[Prv-02]]
- The story of Abraham’s servant finding Rebecca for Isaac’s wife is all about God’s Providence: it’s always there even when we’re walking in the darkness

**Day 13**: [[2022-02-13-Sun]] - [[Gn-25]], [[Gn-26]], [[Jb-15]], [[Jb-16]], [[Prv-02]]
- Isaac does the exact same thing with the same person trying to pass off his wife as his sister: we fall into the same traps again and again  
- Esau trades his birth right to Jacob for a bowl of porridge: if we say yes to anything other than God we are trading in our inheritance

**Day 14**: [[2022-02-15-Tue]] - [[Gn-27]], [[Gn-28]], [[Jb-17]], [[Jb-18]], [[Prv-03]]
- Isaac didn’t take the blessing back after he was deceived: you can’t undo the sacraments  
- parents: give your children the gift of harmony and unity by making them know that you love them and don't have preferences among them

**Day 15**: [[2022-02-17-Thu]] - [[Gn-29]], [[Gn-30]], [[Jb-19]], [[Jb-20]], [[Prv-03]]
- Jacob and Rachel and Leah: God uses our brokenness to bring about his plans

**Day 16**: [[2022-02-18-Fri]] - [[Gn-31]], [[Gn-32]], [[Jb-21]], [[Jb-22]], [[Prv-03]]
- Elaphaz’s understanding of suffering: you reap what you sow. This is a true but partial understanding of suffering.

**Day 17**: [[2022-02-19-Sat]] - [[Gn-33]], [[Gn-34]], [[Jb-23]], [[Jb-24]], [[Prv-03]]
- Jacob’s life had been one of theft and deceit, but it’s the love of God that blesses Jacob  
- Jacob returns the “blessing” to Esau as an act of restoration and forgiveness

**Day 18**: [[2022-02-19-Sat]] - [[Gn-35]], [[Gn-36]], [[Jb-25]], [[Jb-26]], [[Prv-03]]
- God still blesses Esau (through his descendants), as he is of Abraham

**Day 19**: [[2022-02-20-Sun]] - [[Gn-37]], [[Jb-27]], [[Jb-28]], [[Prv-03]]
- story of Joseph and his brothers: often our sense of justice can be twisted to jealousy, envy, and resentment…but the cure is gratitude  
- these stories reveal our hearts to us in their brokenness

**Day 20**: [[2022-03-07-Mon]] - [[Gn-38]], [[Jb-29]], [[Jb-30]], [[Prv-03]]
- Judah means praise, and praise always goes first  
- Tamar is in Jesus family line, the brokenness is there

**Day 21**: [[2022-03-07-Mon]] - [[Gn-39]], [[Gn-40]], [[Jb-31]], [[Jb-32]], [[Prv-03]]

**Day 25**: [[2022-03-13-Sun]] - [[Gn-47]], [[Gn-48]], [[Jb-39]], [[Jb-40]], [[Ps-16]]
- God reveals to Job that there is a bigger story happening and even if you can’t understand it, this moment has meaning  
- Some suffering helps us repent, grow in wisdom, grow more compassionate, but some suffering is redemptive suffering  
- The mystery of the Cross: God knows the full story even when we cannot possibly see it

**Day 26**: [[2022-03-13-Sun]] - [[Gn-49]], [[Gn-50]], [[Jb-41]], [[Jb-42]], [[Ps-17]]
- [[Gn-50#v19]]: “Be not afraid!”
- God’s permissive will: you meant it for evil, but God meant it for good  
- Israel’s blessing of Judah is a prophecy of Jesus  
- Job: the answer for pain and suffering is God himself  
- God’s answer to the question of suffering and evil is himself, the broken and bloodied face of Jesus

I have my mission—I never may know it in this life, but I shall be told it in the next. Somehow I am necessary for His purposes, as necessary in my place as an Archangel in his—if, indeed, I fail, He can raise another, as He could make the stones children of Abraham. Yet I have a part in this great work; I am a link in a chain, a bond of connexion between persons. He has not created me for naught. I shall do good, I shall do His work; I shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place, while not intending it, if I do but keep His commandments and serve Him in my calling.

## Inspiration for "Bible in a Year"

**Source:** [2022-01-23 Holy Family Bulletin](https://holyfamilycolumbus.org/documents/third-sunday-in-ordinary-time)

*The Bible in a year podcast was mentioned at the end of this article in the bulletin, and I loved the story of the priest who had been reading the Bible every year for 24 years.*

Since the beginning of his pontificate, [[Pope Francis]] has given particular attention to how Catholics celebrate the Mass. The Mass is not only, as the [[Vatican II|Second Vatican Council]] clearly taught, the “source and summit of the Christian life,” but also a school. Because the faith of believers is profoundly influenced by the way the Church prays (*lex orandi, lex credendi*), Pope Francis has sought in various ways to strengthen the liturgical curriculum.  

He has buttressed the Marian piety of the Mass, establishing the memorial of Mary, Mother of the Church, on the day after Pentecost and extending the memorial of Our Lady of Loreto to the universal Church. He has bolstered devotion to St. Joseph as the guardian of the Church by requiring his intercession to be invoked in every Eucharistic Prayer. He has underlined the necessary connection between liturgy and charity in establishing in 2017 the World Day of the Poor on the 33rd Sunday of Ordinary Time.  

On January 26, 2020 the Church celebrated for the first time an important new annual feast, the Sunday of the Word of God, which Pope Francis established to accentuate the importance that Sacred Scripture is meant to have in the faith, prayer and lives of believers.  

He announced it intentionally September 2019, on the feast of [[St. Jerome]], the famous translator of the Bible from the Greek and Hebrew into Latin, then the common language of the people. In 2020 the Church marked the 1,600th anniversary of St. Jerome’s death. He is famous for emphasizing, **“Ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ”** - that unless we are familiar with what Jesus said and did in the Gospel, how He fulfilled all the prophecies of the Old Testament, and how the apostles proclaimed Him, we really do not know Him.  

St. Jerome learned this lesson the hard way. As a brilliant young student traveling to study from the great masters of his day, he got deathly ill with something that took the life of his companions. He had been up until this point a lukewarm Christian, far more passionate about Greco-Roman literature than the faith. 

During his sickness he had a dream in which he was appearing before the judgment seat of Christ. When he professed he was a Christian, Jesus replied that he was, rather, a Ciceronian, because he knew far more about Cicero and his writings than he did about Christ and His teachings. It struck Jerome to the core. He didn’t know Christ because he didn’t know the Scriptures! After he awoke and recovered, he resolved to pour his mind, heart and time into the study and diffusion of the Word of God. Pope Francis is hoping that St. Jerome’s example of converted zeal will be contagious.  

In his decree establishing the feast, *Aperuit Illis*, taken from the words in the Emmaus scene describing how Jesus “opened to them what referred to Him in all the Scriptures” (Luke 24:27), Pope Francis said he hopes that this feast will help believers “grow in religious and intimate familiarity with the Sacred Scriptures,” “appreciate the inexhaustible riches contained in that constant dialogue between the Lord and His people,” “experience anew how the risen Lord opens up for us the treasury of His Word and enables us to proclaim its unfathomable riches before the world,” and “marked by this decisive relationship with the living Word ..., grow in love and faithful  
witness.”  

Desiring the feast to be dedicated to the “celebration, study and dissemination of the Word of God,” he made various practical suggestions. He asked that the Sacred Scriptures be “enthroned” during Mass, to focus on the permanent, normative value of God’s Word. He suggested that the installation of lectors or commissioning of readers take place, showing the importance of proclaiming God’s Word and giving extra attention to readers’ formation to proclaim it faithfully and beautifully. He asked priests in a particular way to focus on their preaching, so that the Word of God may be better understood and come more alive in the heads of hearts of believers. He encouraged training in *lectio divina* (prayerful reading of Scripture), so that people may prayerfully assimilate the content of Scripture. And he expressed hope that since the Third Sunday of Ordinary Time either will each year fall within or at the end of the Octave of Prayer for Christian Unity, the Sunday of the Word of God might bear great ecumenical fruit, “since the Scriptures point out, for those who listen, the path to authentic and firm unity.” I would like to underline two points.  

The first is about celebrating the word of God as the great treasure it is. During the 2008 Synod on the Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church, Bishop Antons Justs of Jelgava, Latvia, gave an unforgettable intervention (talk). He described a priest, **Father Viktors, who was arrested by the Soviets for possessing the Bible and commanded him to step on it. Instead, he knelt and kissed it, for which he was condemned to 10 years of hard labor in Siberia**. When he returned a decade later as an emaciated witness to Scripture’s inestimable value, he celebrated Mass with his people. After proclaiming the Gospel, he kissed once more the Word of God, and he and the people cried profusely with gratitude to God.

Father Viktors wasn’t alone in his testimony, “In Latvia, during the Soviet era,” Bishop Justs continued, “no religious books, no Holy Scriptures, no catechisms were allowed to be printed. The reasoning was: If there is no printed Word of God, there will be no religion. So our Latvian people did what the first-century Christians did: They learnt the passages of the Holy Scriptures by heart.” (cf. [[Memorize Scripture]], *[[2021-10-30-Live Not By Lies|Live Not By Lies]]*)

And specifically with regard to celebration, he recounted, “Still today in Latvia there is an oral tradition alive. We stand on the shoulders of our martyrs to proclaim the Word of God. Our grandchildren remember their grandfathers and grandmothers, who died for their faith; they want to be in their turn, heroes of faith. In Latvia, we proclaim the living Word of God! We go in the processions and on the pilgrimages; we sing songs, and we pray and say: ‘This is the Word of God, for which our grandparents died.”’  

A people learning Sacred Scripture by heart, taking the Bible on pilgrimages, proudly proclaiming the Word of God, and seeking to be heroes in witness to it—this is what the Catholic Church is meant to be. This is the type of faith and celebration Pope Francis, by establishing this feast, is trying to catalyze.  

**The second point is about learning Sacred Scripture. About a decade ago, I happened to meet a priest from Cleveland at Green Airport in Providence, Rhode Island. I invited him to lunch. When the cashier asked if there would be one check or two, I said one and gave my credit card. Father Bob immediately interjected, “Sirach says we should go Dutch!” I stared at him quizzically, but retorted, “Jesus calls us to love one another as He loves us and the Last Supper wasn’t Dutch. I’m paying!”**  

**When we got to the table, immediately after grace, I asked whether he had invented the quotation from Sirach. “Not at all,” he enthusiastically replied, as he pulled a worn Bible from his backpack and amazingly opened it to the exact page in the Book of Sirach where it says not to be ashamed to “share the expenses of a business or journey” ([[Sir-42#v3]]).**  

**Blown away, and frankly filled with holy envy by his command of Scripture, I asked how he had come to know the Word of God so well. He told me he had made a promise the day of his diaconal ordination to read the entire Bible once a year and that he had been faithful to that promise. “After 24 years,” he said with a smile, “you get to know what Sirach says about restaurant bills!”**  

I asked him how long it takes to read the whole Bible in a year. He replied that it takes cumulatively only 75 hours, or 12—15 minutes a day.  

Since that encounter, I’ve tried to emulate Father Bob’s commitment to reading the Bible each year and have encouraged many others to join us. Twelve to 15 minutes a day can change your life. There are so many books and smartphone applications that make reading the Bible in a year easier, intelligently varying the passages to help one understand it better than if one just read from cover to cover. I’d encourage you to consult them.  

If ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ, intimate familiarity with the Word of God will help you to know not only the inspired words, but the Word made flesh so much better.
