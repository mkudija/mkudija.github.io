- great compact layout with single column text and double column notes 
- maps, drawings (esp to visualize the OT) , est. 
- would be cool to see [[~Ignatius Catholic Study Bible|ICSB]] in this size 
- look at Catholic resources first, cf. PD
- john 6 and deuterocanon as examples
- 


>6:53 **Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood** cannot be intended literally, for no one ever did that. As Jesus has done frequently in this Gospel, he is speaking in terms of physical items in this world to teach about spiritual realities. Here, to "eat" Jesus' flesh has the spiritual meaning of trusting or believing in him, especially in his death for the sins of mankind. (See also v. 35, where Jesus speaks of coming to him as satisfying "hunger" and believing in him as satisfying "thirst.") Similarly, to "drink his blood" means to trust in his atoning death, which is represented by the shedding of his blood. Although Jesus is not speaking specifically about the Lord's Supper here, there is a parallel theme, because the receiving of eternal life through being united with "the Son of Man" is represented in the Lord's Supper (where Jesus' followers symbolically eat his flesh and drink his blood; cf. 1 Cor. 11:23-32). This is anticipated in OT feasts (see 1 Cor. 5:7) and consummated in the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9).

and 

>6:60 It was a **hard saying** because they wrongly interpreted Jesus' statements literally (see note on v. 53).

(notes on John from the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary)


Notes on the Apocrypha from Roger T. Beckwith (DD University of Oxford)

at least gets the chronology right for the deuterocanon (cf. *[[2024-01-31-Why Catholic Bibles Are Bigger|Why Catholic Bibles Are Bigger]]*): "The Reformers dismissed the Apocrypha from teh canonical OT." (2613) and uses words like "development" and "discontinued" 

Read the essay on Roman Catholicism (2613-2615) for the clear view of differences 

From the introduction: "We should always begin by reading the Bible's actual words, seeking with our hearts and our minds to understand these words and apply them to our lives. Then, after starting with the words of the Bible itself, we can turn to the study notes and many other study Bible resources for information about the background of the text, for the meaning of puzzling words or phrases, and for connections to other parts of the Bible. Finally, we should return again to the Bible itself, reading it with a new and deeper understanding, asking God to speak through his Word to our lives and to draw us near to himself." (9)

"The doctrinal perspective of the ESV Study Bible is that of classic evangelical orthodoxy, in the historic stream of the Reformation." (10) ... but also recognizes differences in "disputed topics such as baptism, the Lord's Supper..." etc.


curious to read more about Evangelical position (essays after Roman Catholic / Orthodoxy)

good resource behind faithful catholic resources like [[~Ignatius Catholic Study Bible|ICSB]] and [[~Gospels and Acts|Navarre Bible—Gospels and Acts]] (cf. *[[2025-05-30-Providentissimus Deus#^84bde7]]*)
