## Introduction: *Sola Scriptura*
- "The Reformation doctrine of *sola Scriptura* is just as important today as it was in the sixteenth century." (21)
- Scripture has always been attacked, but now it's truthfulness and trustworthiness are attacked even by Christians. (22)
- **_Sola Scriptura_ means that only Scripture, because it is God's inspired Word, is our inerrant, sufficient, and final authority for the church.** (23)
	- **Final**: The Bible is our chief, supreme, and ultimate authority that rules over and governs all other authorities, but not our *only* authority. "We could say that while church tradition and church officials play a *ministerial* role, Scripture alone playa a *magisterial* role." (23)
	- **Sufficient**: The Bible provides believers with all the truth they need for salvation and for following after Christ; "The Bible is enough for us." (23-24)
	- **Inerrant**: The ground for biblical authority is divine inspiration, "What Scripture says, God says...Inerrancy is the necessary corollary of inspiration." (25)
- Ironic: "I am aware that my inclusion of inerrancy in our definition of *sola Scriptura* will prove to be controversial, given the mixed identity of evangelicalism today..." (25)
- Outline:
	- Part 1 shows the shift in authority from the time of the Reformation to today.
	- Part 2 shows God's word proving true in the covenants of salvation history.
	- Part 3 systematically explores scriptural attributes.

## Chapter 10: God's Speech Is Enough: The Sufficiency of Scripture
_**Summary**: _
- Defends tradition as having "*ministerial* authority" against evangelicals who would take a "me alone" approach (346)
- "Innovation is often the first indication of heresy. This is why the Reformers sought to tie their exegesis all the way back to the patristic tradition, countering Rome's accusations that the Reformers were inventing new doctrines." (346)
- "Rome affirms a three-legged stool in terms of authority: Scripture, tradition, and the magisterium." (348, cf. *[[2022-12-03-Dei Verbum|Dei Verbum]]*)
- Laments the lack of tradition in protestantism: "Is it any surprise, then, that when a tradition-starved churchgoer stumbles across Rome's veneration of tradition, he decides to cross the Tiber? Indeed, some feel robbed of this rich heritage. So our first response to Rome should be not to rid our churches of tradition, for this will only leave evangelical churches theologically shallow." (352)
- But "we cannot go in the direction of Rome for several reasons": 
	- "Rome reverses the biblical order between the Word of God and the people of God."
		- "A canon exists the minute the books of the New Testament are written." (355)
	- "Rome has misunderstood the role of the church." (355)
	- "Rome has misunderstood the foundational role of the apostles and the nature of authority thereafter." (357)
	- "Rome falls prey to a similar elevation of tradition that Jesus condemned (cf. [[Mk-07#v5]]-13)" (361)


## Conclusion: Always Reforming according to the Word of God
