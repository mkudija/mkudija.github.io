>We think that the greatest victories are yet to be won, the greatest deeds yet to be done. The one plain duty of every man is to face the future as he faces the present, regardless of what it may have in store for him, turning toward the light as he sees the light, to play his part manfully, as a man among men. (484, from *The Winning of the West*)
 
 
 This year starts the Theodore Roosevelt trilogy, following *[[~The Last Lion|Churchill]]* in 2018-2020 and *[[2021-07-20-Witness to Hope|John Paul II]]* in 2021-2023. I'm not sure who will be next, but I have a couple years to figure that out. 
 
 Roosevelt is a man of action. He is a man who takes the initiative and gets things done. "[[2023-06-02-Working Backwards|Bias for action]]" has become a bit of a corporate buzzword. Roosevelt is the original man of action. It started by basically willing himself from feebleness to strenuousness as a boy after his father told him, "You must *make* your body." You see it in his courtship of his wife and his writing of his books, including *The Naval War of 1812* which he started as a student at Harvard and became a classic piece of history. He wouldn't have even been at "the great day of [his] life," the Battle of San Juan, were it not for his initiative to get his Rough Riders on a ship to Cuba. Time and again, he makes things happen: Harvard, New York Assemblyman, cattle rancher, Mayor of New York candidate, Civil Service Commissioner, New York Police Commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Colonel of the Rough Riders, Governor of New York, Vice President, President. As he says: *"It is not often that a man can make opportunities for himself. But he can put himself in such shape that when or if the opportunities come he is ready to take advantage of them*" (126).

 There is something about Roosevelt that is quintessentially American. He represents the best of America when America was at its best. There is something special about America in its ascendency, having come together after the Civil War and before the grave evils and massive changes of the twentieth century—world wars, depression, inflationary monetary policy, international politics, sexual revolution and moral decadence, the rise of the nanny state and consumerism, and the wane of personal responsibility. No era is perfect, but it's easy to feel some nostalgia for this simpler, purer America.

I read this during the 2024 election, and there are some notable similarities between Roosevelt and Ramaswamy. Both are men in another league, both for their resumes and their ability to crank out books. Both bring a fresh perspective to an entrenched politics. I sense that on some level Ramaswamy and the new "America First" movement draw inspiration from Roosevelt and his Americanism. 


## Notes
- The epigraphs at the head of every chapter are taken from Roosevelt's favorite poem, *The Saga of King Olaf* by Longfellow (1)
	- "I had a great admiration for men who were fearless and could hold their own in the world, and I had a great desire to be like them." (16)
- "If a man has a very decided character, has a strongly accentuated career, it is normally the case of course that he makes ardent friends and bitter enemies." (xv)

- The Badlands: "Here the romance of my life began." (200)

	- Morris' analysis: "In quitting him so early, she rendered him her ultimate service. In burying her, he symbolically buried his own lingering naïveté." (234)
	- He was then back to work at once: "There is nothing left for me except to try to so live as not to dishonor the memory of those I loved who have gone before me." (235)
	- "I have never believed it did any good to flinch or yield for any blow. Nor does it lighten the pain to cease from working." (237)
- His dream cabin in Dakota: "A long, low ranch house of hewn logs, with a verandah, and with in addition to the other rooms, a bedroom for myself, and a sitting-room with a big fireplace. There would be a rough desk, well stocked with ink and paper, two or three shelves full of books, and a rubber tub to bathe in. Out front, on a piazza overlooking the river, there would be the inevitable Rooseveltian rocking-chair, in which he could sit reading poetry on summer afternoons, or watching his cattle plod across the sandbars."

- "It was one of the most concise and at the same time one of the cleverest contracts I have ever seen. He made it a condition that the vessel should be delivered under her own steam at a specific point and within a specific period. In one sentence he thus covered all that might have been set forth in pages and pages of specifications. For the vessel had to be in first-class condition to make the time scheduled in the contract!

- Governor of New York: "I have worked hard all my life, and have never been particularly lucky, but this summer I *was* lucky, and I am enjoying it to the full. I know perfectly well that the luck will not continue, and it is not necessary that it should." (722)
