# Part One: True Devotion to the Holy Spirit
## Chapter 1: Introduction
_**Summary**: Christian piety should encourage devotion to the two artisans of Christ, the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary._



## Chapter 2: The Soul's Delightful Guest
_**Summary**: The Holy Spirit is the most sweet Guest of the soul._
- The Holy Spirit is the Artist of Souls. Sanctity is the supreme art (sanctification and possession are the same act). The ideal is Jesus.(7)
- The Holy Spirit is the delightful Guest of souls, *dulcis Hospes animae* (8)
- The Scriptures attribute, in a special manner, this indwelling of the Holy Spirit (8, cf. [[1 Cor-03#v16]], [[Rom-08#v9]], [[Rom-05#v5]], [[Rom-08#v11]], [[Jn-14#v16]]-17)
- God is in our souls in a most particular manner because He loves us...Loving us and giving us the Holy Spirit is the same thing. (9)
- The Holy Spirit leads us to the Word, and through the Word we go to the Father. (11)


## Chapter 3: The Supreme Director 
_**Summary**: The Holy Spirit is the personal and true Director of the soul._
- The Holy Spirit lives in the center of the soul as the Director of the supernatural life. (12)
- The Holy Spirit is our Director by means of his gifts, pour out into:
	- the *intelligence*: wisdom, understanding, counsel, and knowledge
	- the *will*: piety 
	- the *sensible appetites*: fortitude and fear of God
- Sanctity is impossible with the direction of the Holy Spirit. (13)
- The perfection of the soul is measured by its docility to the movement of the Spirit, by the promptitude and fidelity with which its strings produce the divine notes of the song of love. A would is perfectly holy when the Spirit of love has taken full possession of it. (15)
- The inspirations of the Holy Spirit are the vital, perfect impulse of the spiritual life. (15)
- The Holy Spirit brings to our souls the fruitfulness of the Father and binds us lovingly to the Son. (16)

## Chapter 4: The Gift of God
_**Summary**: The Holy Spirit is the first Gift of God._
- Love must possess, as well as be possessed. (17)
- It is characteristic of love to give gifts, but the first gift, the gift par excellence, is love itself. The Holy Spirit is the Love of God; therefore He is the Gift of God. (17)
- We possess the Father and the Son because we possess the Holy Spirit, who is the first Gift of God. (19)
- The Holy Spirit is ours. We can enjoy Him and use His effects. It is in our power to use Him; we can enjoy Him when we wish. Each one of these truths deserves to be extensively and lovingly meditated upon. (20)
- It is in our power to enjoy that happiness which we carry within our souls whenever we wish to, for what is ours is ours to dispose of...Heaven itself is a natural consequence of this love...But the root of both joys, that of heaven and that of earth, is the same. It is the Gift of love. (20-21)
	- → *The Holy Spirit is the key to being joyful!*
- To enjoy God is to know HIm and to love Him. To enjoy the Holy Spirit is to love; to enjoy the Word is to know. (21)
- The spiritual life is the mutual possession of God and the soul, because it is essentially their mutual love. When the Holy Spirit possess a soul completely, and the soul attains the full possession of the Gift of God, this is union, perfection, sanctity. (22)


## Chapter 5: The Divine Cycle
_**Summary**: The Holy Spirit is the source of all other gifts and the first link in the royal chain that terminates in perfection._
- The cycle of love is completed in the Father, for all things find their full perfection when they return to their origin. (24)
- Only the voice of Jesus can intone perfect praise, so it is necessary for the voices of souls to be united to the voice of Jesus that they may ascend to the Father. (25)
- The divine cycle is this: nobody can go to the Father except through Jesus; nobody can go to Jesus except through the Holy Spirit. (28)


## Chapter 6: The Motion of the holy Spirit Through the Gifts
_**Summary**:  The sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit is to form Jesus in souls, thus producing in them the ideal of the Father._
- Both the Master and the disciple have their own instruments of work. For the disciple, they are the **virtues**; for the Master, the **seven gifts**. (32)
- The Holy Spirit is the Artist who unites in a kiss of love the Father and the transformed soul. (36)


## Chapter 7: The Soul's Response
_**Summary**: The action of the Holy Spirit requires the cooperation of the soul, which is the basis of devotion to him._
- His ideal is to produce Jesus in us, and through Jesus and with Jesus, to take us o the bosom of the Trinity and glorify the Father with the supreme glorification of Jesus. (38)
- Devotion to the Holy Spirit is a loving and constant cooperation with His divine influence, His sanctifying work. To be devoted to the Holy Spirit is to open our soul for Him to dwell there, dilate our heart that He may anoint it with His divine charity, deliver our whole being up to Him that He may possess it with His gifts, give Him our life that He may transform it into a divine one, put into His hands the shapeless block of our imperfection that He may mold it to the divine image of Jesus. (38)
- We were consecrated temples of the Holy Spirit on the day of our baptism...Every Christian is a temple of the Holy Spirit; every Christian is consecrated to Him; and nothing else may be done in that temple in which God dwells except that which will give glory to Him. (40)
- True devotion to the Holy Spirit is not something distinct from the Christian life; it *is* the Christian life thoroughly understood, seriously practiced, and deeply enjoyed. To be a devotee of the Holy Spirit is to comprehend the august dignity of the Christian, his holy mission, and his arduous duties that are sweetened by love. It is to establish oneself in truth, to be faithful to the sacred promises of baptism, to be what one ought to be, and then to strive for that perfection to which every Christian should aspire. (40)
- Our consecration to the Holy Spirit must be total. (41)
