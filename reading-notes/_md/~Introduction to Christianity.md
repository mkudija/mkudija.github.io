# INTRODUCTION: "I BELIEVE-AMEN"

## Chapter 1: BELIEF IN THE WORLD OF TODAY
_**Summary**: All men of all ages must wrestle with belief. Modernity struggles with belief because of its aversion to tradition and attraction to a scientific-technical worldview concerned only with facts. Belief appreciates and includes facts, but moves beyond this to all of reality, including the meaning received from above. Christian belief rests in the meaning that knows me and loves me, the logos, Jesus of Nazareth._

**1. Doubt and belief—Man's situation before the question of God**
- We don't have a common understanding to talk about belief today: it's like the clown and the burning village in *The Secular City* by Harvey Cox [[bib]], and the theologian can't get people to take his message seriously (39)
- We can't just "put on the clothes of the world" to be taken seriously (41), and our own faith is fragile and incomplete (42)
- An image that describes our plight as believers today comes from *Soulier de Satin* by Paul Claudel [[bib]]: we are "fastened to the cross—with the cross fastened to nothing, drifting over the abyss" (43-44)
- But the unbeliever is similarly tempted to unbelief of his own unbelief. This challenge of belief is common to all men by nature (45)
- The common "unceasing rivalry between doubt and belief" can be an avenue of connection between believers and non-believers (47)

**2. The origin of belief—Provisional attempt at a definition of belief**
- The [[Apostles' Creed]] is the original "introduction to Christianity" and the guiding thread in this work (48)
	- → as it is in the [[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] which he helped create 20 years later! 
- Belief is a recognition of the reality of the world beyond the immediately visible (50)
- We only come to belief by turning around, by "con-version" (51)
- The challenge of belief is not unique to the scientific world today; it has always been a leap beyond visible reality (51)

**3. The dilemma of belief in the world of today**
- Aversion to tradition prevents belief today (54), and true Christian belief makes real claims that might offend (56) 
- In Christianity, God is revealed in history and made known to man (54 cf. [[Jn-01#v18]]: "No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.")

**4. The boundary of the modern understanding of reality and the place of belief**
- Modernity has settled on the scientific attitude (a combination of mathematical and factual thinking) as the default way of understanding the world (57-58)
- The birth of the **historical** approach (58):
	- The ancient understanding is "it is true because God thought it" (thinking and making are the same)
	- [[Descartes]] (early modernity) says that certainty is the purely formal intellectual purged of the uncertainties of the factual (mathematical certainty)
	- [[Vico]] marked the transition to a modern attitude by saying "it is true if we made it" (truth in mathematics and history); replaced thinking about being with history 
	- Other thinkers came to see their disciplines through the lens of history: philosophy for [[Hegel]] and [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], theology for [[F.C. Baur]]; economics for [[Marx]]
- The turn toward **technical thinking** (63):
	- The next turn, by [[Marx]] is that we must *change* the world. We used to be focused on the *eternal*, then the *past*, now the *future*
	- This leads to the manipulation of man by his own planning and the reduction of man to a "fact"
- The question of the place of belief (66):
	- Christianity has a decisive connection to the forces of modernity (history and making the world better), and must rise to the challenge of filling in the blind spots of past periods of theological reflection 

**5. Faith as standing firm and understanding**
- [[Heidegger]]: there are two attitudes of relating to reality that operate on different planes are are both necessary: calculating thought concerned with *makability*, and reflective thought concerned with *meaning* (71)
- Belief is "an essentially different kind of intellectual attitude, which stands alongside practical knowledge as something independent" (71)
- [[Marxism]] is "the most impressive attempt to incorporate the attitude of 'belief' into the attitude of practical knowledge" (72)

>What is **belief** really? It is a human way of taking up a stand in the totality of reality, a way that cannot be reduced to knowledge and is incommensurable with knowledge; it is the bestowal of meaning without which the totality of man would remain homeless, on which man's calculations and actions are based, and without which in the last resort he could not calculate and act, because he can only do this in the context of a meaning that bears him up (72).

- Meaning cannot be made but only received (72), and it is because we have received that we can make (73)

>To believe as a Christian means in fact entrusting oneself to the meaning that upholds me and the world; taking it as the firm ground on which I can stand fearlessly...Christianity means understanding our existence as a response to the word, the *logos*, that upholds and maintains all things (72.)

**6. The rationality of faith**

>Truth is the only ground suitable for man to stand upon (76).

- Our understanding grows out of belief, out of that meaning which we have entrusted ourselves to (77)

**7. "I believe in you"**

>Christian faith lives on the discovery that not only is there such a thing as objective meaning but that this meaning knows me and loves me, that I can entrust myself to it like the child who knows that everything he may be wondering about is safe in the "you" of his mother (80).


>I believe in you, Jesus of Nazareth, as the meaning (*logos*) of the world and of my life (81).


## Chapter 2: THE ECCLESIASTICAL FORM OF FAITH
_**Summary**: The Creed's roots are in the dialogue of the baptismal rite expressing the fundamental Christian belief in the Trinity. This dialogue demonstrates the communal aspect of faith and how the Creed is an instrument of unity._

**1. Introductory remarks on the history and structure of the Apostles' Creed**
- The creed grew out of baptismal rites of the 2nd and 3rd century (based on [[Mt-28#v19]]), and was originally a dialogue: "Do you believe...?"

**2. Limits and meaning of the text**
- The Creed expresses the common ground of belief in the triune God, but also has roots of the [[East-West Schism of 1054]]

**3. Creed and dogma**
- The dialogue of the creed gets closer to the heart of Christina faith than any later formal dogmas (89)

>Faith is located in the act of conversion, in the turn of one's being from worship of the visible and practicable to trust in the invisible (89).


**4. The Creed as expression of the structure of faith**
- Unlike philosophy which proceeds from individual reflection, faith comes from something heard and received; in faith the word takes precedence over the thought (91, cf. [[Rom-10#v17]]: "faith comes from what is heard")
- Faith has a fundamentally social character, and our goals is to make what is received more and more our own (92)
- Doctrine (*symbolum*) aims at unity: the faith we hold can only be complete with that of others (98)
	- → cf. *[[~Confessions#Book VIII: The Birthpangs of Conversion|Confessions, 8, 2, 3-5]]* [[bib]] (99)

>Christian doctrine does not exist in the form of discrete propositions but in the unity of the baptismal profession of faith (96)...Christian belief is not an idea but life (100).


# PART ONE: GOD

## Chapter 1: PROLEGOMENA TO THE SUBJECT OF GOD
_**Summary**: Christian belief in God grows out of Israel and embraces the entire human experience, uniting philosophy and religious practice in monotheism. Similar to polytheism, our idolatry against the Christian God tempts us to make absolutes out of things that are not. The belief in the Christian God has important implications for practical life, including politics and marriage._

**1. The scope of the question**
- What is "God" and what does it signify? (103)
- [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer|Bonhoeffer]]: God is not an escape that becomes more superfluous as our powers expand
	- →But Ratzinger says "Both the poverty of human experience and its fullness point to God" (105)...we can be led to God both by loneliness and the joy of human love (106)
- Monotheism, polytheism, and atheism are "all convinced of the unity and uniqueness of the absolute; where they differ is only in their notions of the manner in which man has to deal with the absolute" (109)
	- Ancient philosophy embraced both philosophical atheists (Epicurus, Lucretius) and philosophical monotheists ([[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], Plotinus) and both groups were by religion polytheists. Christianity is revolutionary where philosophical and religious orientations becomes identical (109)

**2. The profession of faith in the one God**
- Our Christian faith in God has roots in Jewish prayer: "Hear, O Israel, Yahweh, thy God, is an only God" (110)
- The fundamental issue with [[Polytheism]] is that it makes absolutes out of what is not in itself the absolute (bread, Eros, power), and thereby make slaves of men (111)
	- Our temptation to idolatry is the same temptation to make something less than God absolute (cf. 114) 
- Assenting to the Christian creed means renouncing at the same time the laws of the world (112)
- We can change the world if we are willing to suffer (113)
- "I Believe" is important for politics, precisely because it has no political aim (113)
- "I Believe" is decisive for [[marriage]]: 

> The unity, finality, and indivisibility of the love between man and woman can in the last analysis only be made a reality and understood in the light of belief in the unity and indivisibility of the love of God. We are beginning to understand more and more clearly today that this concept of love is by no means a philosophically deducible, self-supporting principle and that to a large extent it stands or falls with belief in the one God. We are also coming to understand more and more clearly that the apparent liberation of love and its conversion into a matter of impulse mean the delivery of man to the autonomous powers of sex and Eros, to whose merciless slavery he falls victim just when he is under the illusion that he has freed himself. When he eludes God, the gods put out their hands to grasp him; he can only be liberated by allowing himself to be liberated and by ceasing to try to rely on himself (114).

## Chapter 2: THE BIBLICAL BELIEF IN GOD
_**Summary**: _

**1. The problem of the story of the burning bush**
- The burning bush is the central text for the understanding of the Old Testament God: "I am who I am" (116, cf. [[Ex-03#v14]])
- In this the Fathers of the Church saw a unity between philosophy ([[Plato]]) and faith (Moses)
- Philology (H. Cazelles) shows how the *yau* or *ya* meaning "my God" makes the God of Israel personal (121)

**2. The intrinsic assumption of the belief in Yahweh: The God of [Israel's] fathers**
- Holy places lead to local gods. But Israel's personal God is of men, not a place, and is therefore transcendent: "he is to be found at any place where man is and where man lets himself be found by him" (123) and he "can be the God of each and every man" (126)

**3. Yahweh, the "God of our Fathers" and [[2014-01-31-The God of Jesus Christ|The God of Jesus Christ]]**
- 

**4. The idea of the name**
