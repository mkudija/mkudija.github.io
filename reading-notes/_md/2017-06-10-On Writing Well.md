# On Writing Well by William Zinsser

* cut cut cut
    * don't use adjectives unnecessarily
    * don't modify a word that already contains the meaning you need
    * don't use a complicated word when a simple one will work
* If you think clearly, you will write clearly
* Don't use a word in writing that you wouldn't use in conversation
* Don't try to be in your writing someone you are not: be true to who you are
* The only person you are writing for is yourself, so donâ€™t ever worry if the reader likes you or agrees with you
* Humor is a lubricant in writing
* Re-writing is the essence of writing 
* Use active verbs rather than passive verbs (something that you can picture someone doing) 
* Use short, blunt, simple, sacramental nouns 
* Writing is learned by imitation 
* Read everything you write aloud and make sure it sounds good
