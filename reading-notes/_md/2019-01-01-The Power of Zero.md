- "The best way to insulate yourself from the impact of rising tax rates is to put yourself in the 0% tax bracket." (81)
- We have some of the lowest tax rates in history (chart on 10 and 2018 tax chapter on 67).
- **The Taxable Bucket**: keep 6 months of living expenses here for *liquidity* (checking/savings, CD, stocks, bonds, etc.)
- **The Tax-Deferred Bucket**: contribute enough to get any employer 401(k) match but not much if any more
  - If taxes are the same, it doesn't matter. But if taxes go up, you would rather pay them now.
- **The Tax-Free Bucket**: maximize remaining contributions into the tax-free bucket (Roth IRA and LIRP) to have as much income as possible not taxed in retirement.
