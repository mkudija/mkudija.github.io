### 112. Monetary Crisis
- Debasement of the Roman coinage had begun as early as the reign of Nero. But in the third century, with mounting inflation, widespread hoarding of specie, and sharply reduced revenues, the emperors resorted to reckless adulteration of the imperial coinage to meet their military and administrative costs. As a result, distrust of new currency was widely manifested, by individuals as well as by banks. Ultimately the government refused to accept its own coinage for many taxes and insisted on payment in kind. (398) ^841c97
