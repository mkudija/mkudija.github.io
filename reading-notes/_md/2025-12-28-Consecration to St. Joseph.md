**Daily Notes**
- Day 1: Joseph is “the increaser” of our faith  
- Day 2: we need to be “apparitions” of Joseph to radiate his virtues  
- Day 3: as Jesus’ father, Joseph is the image of God the Father on earth
- Day 4: To Jesus through Mary and Joseph  
- Day 5: Joseph’s prayer is a model of the interior life
- Day 6: the Holy Family is an icon of the Trinity, and Joseph is the head of the Holy Family
- Day 7: Imitate Jesus in entrusting ourselves to Mary and Joseph. Joseph will bless those who honor Mary.
- Day 8: Marriage is at the heart of creation (Adam & Eve) and redemption (Mary & Joseph). St. Joseph will help us get to the wedding feast of heaven.
- Day 9: Joseph is a Noble Lord, the King of the Holy Family
- Day 10: Joseph is a reflection of the Father of Lights
- Day 11: St. Joseph is the model husband and father. The vocation of men is to be at the service of those entrusted to their love and care.
- Day 12: Joseph is chaste and pure if heart—a gentleman
- Day 13: as foster father of Jesus, Joseph is the "nurturer of the Son of God", *Filii Dei Nutricie*
- Day 14: a father’s work is never finished until his children are safely home in heaven
- Day 15: make St. Joseph the spiritual head of your home
- Day 16: "Joseph most Just" always seeks to do the will of God and render to him his due
- Day 17: St. Joseph will fight for you if you invoke his name!
- Day 18: Joseph will help you exercise supernatural prudence and embrace the cross out of love
- Day 19: Joseph will help you to be courageous and to love the good more than you fear evil or suffering 
- Day 20: Obedience requires trust 
- Day 21: A Christian's relationship with God is a spiritual marriage, and we need to be faithful just like we are in a human marriage 
- ★ Day 22: If you want to be like St. Joseph, you must learn patience. God allows trials because he wants us to grow in virtue. A concrete area in your life where you can exercise the virtue of patience is by being merciful to others, especially when you know their faults.
- Day 23: The Holy Family lived on Divine Providence, such as the gifts from the Wise Men to sustain them for their journey to Egypt. 
- Day 24: St. Joseph will teach us how to be honest and diligent workers, like he did Jesus.
- Day 25: Wherever St. Joseph is present, Jesus and Mary are present as well.
- Day 26: Frequently ask St. Joseph's intercession to keep your heart pure and chaste.
- Day 27: When the Holy Family is celebrated in society, we will again know the sanctity of motherhood, the heroism of fatherhood, and the blessing of children.
- Day 28: God wants you to rest in St. Joseph’s fatherhood. Saint Joseph will never abandon you.
- Day 29: If you or someone you know is sick, go to St. Joseph.
- Day 30: We need St. Joseph’s intercession at our hour of death.
- Day 31: St. Joseph is a dragon slayer
- Day 32: The "smoke of Satan has entered the Church", but Joseph is here to protect it
- Day 33: Our spiritual father St. Joseph is lord, chief, and guardian of the treasures of heaven!
