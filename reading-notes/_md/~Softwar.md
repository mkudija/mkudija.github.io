* "Bitcoin is a new type of cyber warfighting technology and will be critical to national defense."
* We use physical power to physically constrain people and impose physically prohibitive costs on people who would harm us.
* To physically constrain data and computers you build a "macrochip" or the global electric power grid 
* Bitcoin converts power grid into a giant physically expensive computer used to secure data and messages passing across the internet 
* Bitcoin satisfies the same function of other warfighting technologies in a different form
