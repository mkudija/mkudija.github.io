### 2nd Sunday in Ordinary Time 
*[[1 Sm-03#v3]]-19*
*[[Ps-40]]*: "I delight to do your will, O my God!"
*[[1 Cor-06#v13]]-20*
*[[Jn-01#v35]]-42*

- Today's readings emphasize the *personal* view of God, who knows us by name
- Eli mentors Samual to move to a direct, personal, and mediated relationship with God 
- [[Ps-40#v8]] "To do your will is my delight, and your law is within my heart!" pairs well with [[1 Jn-05#v2]]-3: "For the love of God is this, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome." God's law is an expression of his love for us, because it gives us the pathway to share in his intimacy! Recall [[Jer-31#v33]]: "IÂ will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
- The second reading reminds us that sex is a physical act with a personal meaning, the total gift of self. "The meaning of the sexual act is inherent in itself" (203).
- The Gospel has one of my favorite lines from [[Michael Pakaluk]]'s *[[2023-10-01-Mary's Voice in the Gospel According to John#^621043|translation]]* of [[Jn-01#v38]]: "But Jesus turns in his tracks and takes a look at them." A new name from Christ expresses the intimacy of our relationship with him.
