### 2nd Sunday in Ordinary Time 
*[[1 Sm-03#v3]]-19*
*[[Ps-40]]*: "I delight to do your will, O my God!"
*[[1 Cor-06#v13]]-20*
*[[Jn-01#v35]]-42*

- Today's readings emphasize the *personal* view of God, who knows us by name
- Eli mentors Samual to move to a direct, personal, and mediated relationship with God 
- [[Ps-40#v8]] "To do your will is my delight, and your law is within my heart!" pairs well with [[1 Jn-05#v2]]-3: "For the love of God is this, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome." God's law is an expression of his love for us, because it gives us the pathway to share in his intimacy! Recall [[Jer-31#v33]]: "I will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
- The second reading reminds us that sex is a physical act with a personal meaning, the total gift of self. "The meaning of the sexual act is inherent in itself" (203).
- The Gospel has one of my favorite lines from [[Michael Pakaluk]]'s *[[2023-10-01-Mary's Voice in the Gospel According to John#^621043|translation]]* of [[Jn-01#v38]]: "But Jesus turns in his tracks and takes a look at them." A new name from Christ expresses the intimacy of our relationship with him. 

### 3rd Sunday in Ordinary Time 
*[[Jon-03#v1]]-5, 10*
*[[Ps-25]]*: "Tech me your ways, O Lord." 
*[[1 Cor-07#v29]]-31*
*[[Mk-01#v14]]-20*

- "Drop what you're doing and come now!" is the urgency in today's readings.
- Note the contrast between Jonah and the Gentiles in their response to God: the sailors seek his will, and the Ninevites are an example of the immediate repentance necessary when we hear the voice of God 
- Thesis of Jonah: God is the God of the Gentiles too 
- Note the similarity between [[Ps-25#v10]] ("All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth toward those who honor his covenant") and [[Rom-08#v28]] ("All things work for good for those who love God", i.e. *Omnia in bonum*). Those who are humble are taught by God.
- Paul reminds us that we have limited time to respond to God! WE need to be detached from the things of the world: the importance of all these things has been "radically relativized" by our relationship with God. Heeding God's call takes priority over all our other commitments, occupations, and distractions.
- [[Mk-01#v17]] "fishers of men" is the [[Old Testament prophecies fulfilled by Christ|fulfillment]] of [[Jer-16#v16]] 
	- It's only ethical to leave to study the Torah: Jesus calling Simon, Andrew, James, and John away from fishing is a claim to divinity (213, cf. *[[~Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus of Nazareth]]*)
- *Reflection: What is Jesus calling me to abandon in order to follow him this week?*

### 4th Sunday in Ordinary Time 
*[[Dt-18#v15]]-20*
*[[Ps-95]]*
*[[1 Cor-07#v32]]-35*
*[[Mk-01#v21]]-28*

- Theme today is hearing the voice of the prophet 
- From [[Dt-18]] "a Prophet like Moses" is one of the three marks of the expected Messiah (along with Elijah from [[Mal-04#v5]]) and Son of David from [[Ez-37#v24]]-25 et. al.), which is why they ask John the Baptist in [[Jn-01#v21]] "Are you the Prophet?"
- Paul says that singleness is to be encouraged because it means freedom to be fully focused on the Lord: such a person is able to hear and respond more quickly and fully to the voice of God. 
	- Celibacy is not a restriction imposed on men who want to be priests, but a decision to choose priest from among those who are already celibate 
- [[Fr. Gabriele Amorth]]: "Satan is much more enraged when we take souls away from him through confession than when we take bodies through exorcism." (*[[~An Exorcist Tells His Story#^feaff3]]*)

### 5th Sunday in Ordinary Time 
*[[Jb-07#v1]]-4, 6-7*
*[[Ps-147]]*
*[[1 Cor-09#v16]]-19, 22-23*
*[[Mk-01#v29]]-39*

- Job does not appear much in the lectionary, but is valuable for its description of God's providence and how sin suffering do not always have a direct causal relationship 
- In the second reading we find how the desire to spread the Gospel can give us the desire and strength to endure hardships 
- Mark's Gospels shows us how Jesus relieves our sufferings 


### 6th Sunday in Ordinary Time 
*[[Lv-13#v1]]-2, 44-46*
*[[Ps-32]]*
*[[1 Cor-10#v31]]-11:1*
*[[Mk-01#v40]]-45*

- The first reading gives the background for understanding leprosy, which disrupted communion with both God and man
- The second reading reminds us to consider the example our actions have for others
- The Gospel healing of the lepers shows how the effect of miracles can be less than people think, and how the real leprosy is not external but internal


### 1st Sunday of Lent 
*[[Gn-09#v8]]-15*
*[[Ps-25]]*
*[[1 Pt-03#v18]]-22*
*[[Mk-01#v12]]-15*

- The first readings during Lent in all three years teach salvation history 
- The theme this Sunday is "the new creation": Noah's flood is the great example of this, where God's mercy is greater than his justice and the covenant with Noah foreshadows the New Covenant in Christ 
- [[Ps-25]] celebrates the covenant relationship between God and humanity. A covenant forms a family relationship that creates mutual obligations and which provides the context for profound love and intimacy.
- Mark's description of Jesus 40-day journey to the desert suggests a return to the primeval state of humanity 

### 2nd Sunday of Lent 
*[[Gn-22#v1]]-18*
*[[Ps-116]]*
*[[Rom-08#v31]]-34*
*[[Mk-09#v2]]-10*

- This week's readings anticipate Christ's self-sacrifice on Calvary 
- The *Aqedah* (הָדֵקֲע) binding of Isaac is an icon of Abraham's whole life
	- Isaac, by carrying the wood, was stronger than Abraham and therefore cooperated, "a death he freely accepted"
	- Isaac is Abraham's only son, *Yahid* (יָחִיד), translated as "only begotten" by RSV2CE which corresponds to the Greek *monogenes* (μονογενής) "only begotten" of [[Jn-03#v16]]
	- The [[Septuagint]] renders *yahid* as *agapetos* (ἀγαπητός) "beloved" with parallels to the "beloved son" of the Baptism ([[Mk-01#v11]]) and Transfiguration ([[Mk-09#v7]])
	- Got is asking Abraham and Isaac: "Are you willing to participate in the king of self-sacrificial love that I, the Holy Trinity, will have to demonstrate in order to save mankind?" 
	- The sacrifice of Isaac also later referneced in [[Jas-02#v21]]-23, [[Heb-11#v17]]-19
	- The Lord's oath of blessing to Abraham refers to a descendent, who is Christ (cf. [[Gal-03#v16]])
- [[Ps-116]] is one of the most important *Todah* (תּוֹדָה) "Thanksgiving sacrifice" psalms 
	- "I will **walk** before the Lord": the same word **walk** (halak, הָלַךְ) is used in [[Gn-22#v8]] for Abraham and Isaac
	- Eucharist means Thanksgiving, and it is the eternal *Todah*
- The Transfiguration is an anticipation of Calvary, this is the mystery of our faith: God's glory revealed through weakness, suffering, and humility 
	- Moses and Elijah represent the Law and the Prophets 
	- The Transfiguration was a consolation to strengthen the faith of the three primary Apostles as they undertook with Jesus his final death march into Jerusalem 

> If you really want to be a penitent soul—both penitent and cheerful—you must above all stick to your daily periods of prayer, which should be intimate, generous, and not cut short. And you must make sure that those minutes of prayer are not done only when you feel the need, but at fixed times, whenever it is possible. Don't neglect these details.
> If you subject yourself totally to this daily worship of God, I can assure you that you will always be happy. 
> –*Furrow* by [[St. Josemaría Escrivá]] (81)
