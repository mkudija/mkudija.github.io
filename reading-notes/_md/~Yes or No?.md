## Introduction
- [[Pascal]]'s *[[2014-01-25-Penseés|Penseés]]* [[bib]]: there are three kinds of people:
	1. Those who have sought God and found him
	2. Those who have sought him and not yet found him
	3. Those who neither seek him nor find him
- [[Curiosity]]: "Questions express interest, and will—the will to know. This is infinitely precious, because it is (at least unconsciously) a search for God under his attribute of truth. This is the only honest reason why anyone should ever believe Christianity, or anything else: because it is true."
