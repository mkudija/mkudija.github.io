	* “It starts by wanting to create a classic” (20) - Robert Greene
* Ideas Are Not Enough
	* Ideas are cheap
	* “I’ve met with no shortage of smart, accomplished people who, I’ve realized, don’t actually want to write a book despite what they say. They want to have a book” (22)
* Why Create?
	* “To create something is a daring, beautiful act” (23)
* What Will You Sacrifice?

* The Drawdown Period
	* you need silence; John Boyd called these “drawdown periods”: “an idea must be given space to develop” (40)
* Test Early, Test Often
	* “The key is to catch them early. And the only way to do that is by doing the work at least partly in front of an audience. A book should be an article before it’s a book, an a dinner conversation before it’s an article” (42)
* The Question Almost No One Asks
	* Who Is This For? - Who is your audience
	* “An audience isn’t a target that you happen to bump into; instead, it must be explicitly scoped and sighted in. It must be chosen” (45)
	* “Picking a lane isn’t limiting. It’s the first act of empowerment we take as a creator” (45)

	* be brash, but within the confines of your industry/genre so that you can be appropriately controversial 
* Is it the Best You Can Do?
	* “literature is writing meant to be read twice-everything else is mere journalism” - Cyril Connolly (57)

* Find Your “Editor”
	* You need an editor for detached objectivity
