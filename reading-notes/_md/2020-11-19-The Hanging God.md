`(Brooklyn: Angelico, 2018), 106`

This is a beautiful collection of poems by my favorite living poet. I bought this initially to have a hard copy of *[Autumn Road](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2017/10/autumn-road)*, which resonates with me so much and I try to read each fall. I also love praying the *[The Stations of the Cross](https://www.clarionreview.org/2017/03/stations-of-the-cross/)* with his poetry (Stations VI, XI, and XIII are my favorite).

Some favorite lines:
- "And since man has lost the true good, everything can appear equally good to him, even his own destruction." —[[Pascal]] (*[[2014-01-25-Penseés|Penseés]]*, Section VII, 425)
- *The Consolation of Oranges*: "[[Atheism|Atheists]] are those / Who, having looked at symbols spelled / In branching letters, scattered dust, / See only things, not what they mean." (9)
- "What is a person without this? What is a person without a life-form, that is to say, without a form which he has chosen for his life, a form into which and through which to pour out his life, so that his life becomes the soul of the form and the form becomes the expression of his soul?" —[[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]
- *Stations of the Cross, XI*: "For us, who keep our kitchens clean, / Who'd never have ourselves thought mean, / We had them drive the final nail." (63)
- *Autumn Road*: "For what the rough voiced future will demand." (81)
