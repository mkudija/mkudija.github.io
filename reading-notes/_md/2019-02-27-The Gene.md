- *genes* (information) encode *RNAs* to build *proteins* to form/regulate *organisms* that sense *environments* that influence *proteins/RNA* that regulate *genes* (163, 178, 258, 410)
- "Three profoundly destabilizing scientific ideas ricochet through the twentieth century, trisecting it into three unequal parts: the atom, the byte, the gene. Each is foreshadowed by and earlier century, but dazzles into full prominence in the twentieth. (9)
- "Hereditary identities borrowed from two organisms had been shuffled around to form a new one; it was as close to metaphysics as you could get." (214)
- Victor McKusick: "mutations are just variations" (264)
  - disabilities are caused by and *incongruity* between an individual's genetic endowment and his or her current environment"
- discussion of abortion:
  - "the division of pregnancy into trimesters was a biologically arbitrary invention" (268)
  - awful: "The 'right to be born' is being qualified by another right: to have a reasonable chance of a happy and useful life" —Joseph Dancis (269)
  - not logically coherent: "The court asserted that the right of a child to be born free of [genetic] anomalies is a fundamental right." (271)
  - but selective abortion based on genetic testing is just eugenics reborn (272)
- "Glory be to God for dappled things." —GMH (278)
- umm...no: "the moon rocket...was just a massive jet plane pointed vertically at the moon", but his point is that conceptual shifts are more important than scale shifts in scientific understanding (293)
- Mitochondrial Eve: the common mother of all humanity (338)
- humans are very similar genetically but we are culturally very inclined to exaggerate differences (343)
- genetic variation is not absolute but good or bad depending on environment, i.e. dyslexia wasn’t an issue until people started to read 
- tragic and heartbraking story of a man (Paul Gelsinger) trying to get to his dying son (Jessie): he "walked a mile and a half through the whistling storm to the hospital to see Jesse in the ICU"
- eugenics: "We would certainly eliminate Erika's mutation from the human gene pool—but we would eliminate Erika as well..." (452)
- unpredictability of gene expression is a good reason to tread lightly in research
- the worst eugenic atrocity is not Nazis but selectively killing baby girls in India and China
- “Choice, in short, seems like an illusion decided by genes to ensure the propagation of similar genes” 458
