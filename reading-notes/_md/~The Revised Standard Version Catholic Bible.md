- got from Amazon 2023-11-18 for $21.79, but returned 
- really nice little hard-cover version 
- same text block as my *[[~Ignatius Catholic Bible|Zipper Ignatius Catholic Bible]]* with the following differences 
	- no rounded corners
	- paper is more white than cream 
	- no reference to Ignatius on title page
