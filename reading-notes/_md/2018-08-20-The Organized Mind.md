# *The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload* by Daniel J. Levitin

`(New York: Penguin, 2014), 396`


**Fundamental Principle of Organization**: “shift the burden of organizing from our brains to the external world” (370)


## Chapter 1 - History of Cognitive Overload
- Paradox of choice (someone who lived in communist Romania and then moved to the US)
- Highly Successful People have employees who filter things for them so they never need to worry about focusing on the right thing 
- We have strong filters (change, importance) that help us focus on what is important and ignore everything else 
- Switching attention comes with high costs; our brain is optimized to do one thing at a time 
- Active sorting: shift organization from your mind to the physical world (Gibsonian affordances)


## Chapter 2 - How Attention and Memory Work
- Mind wandering mode (decentralized network) bs central executive mode 
- Four parts of attentional system: wandering, central executive, switching, filtering? 
- The central executive can be thought of as a series of lenses for zooming in and out on the appropriate category 
- Theoretically you can represent every known particle in the universe with your brain...crazy 
- Analog: prevalence of using tangible things to external use memory, such as notebook and pen 
- Index cards and systems for tasks: 2 minute rule, do no, delegate, defer, drop, etc 


## Chapter 3 - Organizing our Homes 
- ACE hardware: items in functional categories but also located near similar items since they will likely be associated by your mind or the task at hand 
- Reading this (colored pants in department store for instance) makes me think about principles of visualization and how our minds categorize information. 
- To not lose things, have a designated place 
- Key point/strategy: use the environment to offload items out of your mind 
- How to organize your home:
  1. Define categories that are meaningful to you
  2. Avoid putting too many different things in the same category, unless a misc item
- Organization rules:
  1. A mislabeled item is worse than a not labeled item
  2. If there is an existing standard, use it
  3. Don’t keep what you can’t use 
- Digital home: Have a separate device (computer) dedicated to different activities, with different background, etc to make it recognizable 
- Declare “email bankruptcy” and delete/archive everything and start over 


## Chapter 4 - Organizing our Social Lives 
- Recaptcha for OCR training 


## Chapter 5 - Organizing our Time 
- Negative genes that kick in after peak age of reproduction don’t have a means for natural selection to weed them out 
- Reasons why multi tasking doesn’t work 
- Prefrontal cortex for breaking a project into components and planning 
- Car wash example: split jobs with different attentional sets to reduce cognitive costs of switching 
- Sleep is important for consolidating memories and solving problems 
- Bi-modal sleep was the norm for most of our history and changed only with the invention of artificial light 
- He gives recommendations for helping your body adjust to travel across time zones 
- Eat the frog: do the worst task first thing in the day 
- Being outside in nature replenishes self-regulatory mechanisms in the brain
- Successful people don’t subscribe to a faulty belief that life should be easy
- To focus:
  1. Write everything you need to do down to get it off your mind
  2. Take a break and exercise 
  3. 5-minute rule for little tasks 


## Chapter 6 - Organizing Information for the Medical Decisions
- Discussion of probabilities and common fallacies 
- Bayes: "Organizing our decisions requires that we combine the base rate information with other relevant diagnostic information" (229)...Base rates and representativeness hueristic 
- Applying Bayes to decisions about your medical treatment 
- Our brains easily notice co-occurrence of events, but not lack of occurrences 
- Parking ticket example:
  - Parking costs $20
  - Parking ticket costs $50, and there is a 25% chance you get a parking ticket
  - Therefore, the expected value of paying for parking is -$20, and the expected value of not paying for parking is 25% * -$50 = -$12.50. So you shouldn't pay for parking.


**Fourfold (contingency tables)**: allows us to calculate Bayesian probability models, for example "What is the probability that I have a disease, *given* that I already tested positive for it?"...example (page 231+ and appendix):
- You took a blood test that came back positive for the disease
- The blood test is wrong 2% of the time (false positive and false negative)
- The base rate of disease is 1 in 10,000 (0.0001)
- Medication ends with unwanted side effect 5% (0.05) of the time
- Should you take the medicine...?

Here is our four-fold table:

| | Test (Positive) | Test (Negative) | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Disease (Yes) | Correct ID | False Negative | 
| Disease (No) | False Positives | Correct rejections | 


| | Test (Positive) | Test (Negative) | **Totals** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Disease (Yes) | 1 (1-0)| 0 (1 * 2%) | **1** |
| Disease (No) | 200 (9,999 * 2%) | 9,799 (9,999-200) | **9,999** |
| **Totals** | 201 | 9,799 | **10,000** | 

Now, to answer our question: what is the probability I have the disease given that I tested positive?

Or, *p(You have the disease | You tested positive)* = 1/201 = 0.49%

Say we decide to take the test a second time (assuming that test results are independent):

| | Test (Positive) | Test (Negative) | **Totals** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Disease (Yes) | 1 (1-0)| 0 (1 * 2%) | **1** |
| Disease (No) | 4 (200 * 2%) | 196 (200-4) | **200** |
| **Totals** | 5 | 196 | **201** | 

*p(You have the disease | You tested positive twice)* = 1/5 = 20%



## Chapter 7 - Organizing the Business World 
- Fundamental principle of this book: externalize memory 
- Many great leaders are also great storytellers 
- Internal locus of control: being in control of our lives, which promotes success, happiness, satisfaction 
- Take 10 minutes after meeting or stopping project to write what happened or prep for starting the next time 
- Plan for failure with your IT infrastructure, file types, etc 


## Chapter 8 - What to Teach our Children 
- Discussion of benefits and (mostly) risks of Wikipedia model of knowledge 
- Because information is so accessible on the internet, the purpose of education shifts partially to identifying experts and determining the credibility of information you find 
- Think about numbers logically to see if they are plausible. Set boundary conditions 
- Back of the envelope test: estimating the weight of the Empire State Building 
- With kids: how many uses can you think of for a pencil? 


## Chapter 9 - The Power of the Junk Drawer
- Fundamental principle of organization: “shift the burden of organizing from our brains to the external world” (370)
- For remembering names, you need to give yourself 5 seconds to encode the information (374)
- The 21 century information issue is one of selection
