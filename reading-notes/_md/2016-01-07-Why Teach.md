# *Why Teach* by Mark Edmundson

* [[Reading]]: we need to read authors through the lens of that author, not though the lens of subsequent authors. We should treat the author like a friend who we are representing to another friend: charitable to their worldview in how we give an account of their writing that they would agree is fair
* We need to allow faith to enter into the teaching of humanities, to let the students bring their "final vocabulary" (their final principles, how they assign meaning in the world, their faith) into the conversation so it can be examined and open to change 
* Great book: one that can inspire you to change how you live
* Study other cultures, yes, but not at the expense of knowing yourself (your own culture)
