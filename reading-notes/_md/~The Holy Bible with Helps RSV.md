### [[Deuterocanonical Books|The Apocrypha]]

The Apocrypha are those books and portions of books which appear in the Latin Vulgate, either as part of the Old Testament or as an appendix, but are not included in Hebrew Scripture. With the exception of 2 Esdras these books appear in the Septuagint, but are not found in the Hebrew Canon of Holy Scripture. 

Because they were included in the Latin Vulgate, the church of the medieval period considered them to be part of the Scriptures. The Council of Trent, in 1546, decreed that the apocryphal books, (with the exception of the Prayer of Manasseh and 1 and 2 Esdras) were to be part of the Canon of the Old Testament and declared anathema on anyone who rejected them.

In Luther's German translation of the Bible (1534), the Apocrypha stand between the Old and New Testaments. Coverdale's English Bible of 1535 gave them the same position. These books had a place in all English translations of the Bible in the sixteenth century and also in the King James Version of 1611. In all of the above translations, mention was made to the effect that the Apocrypha; while not accepted by Protestant and Hebrew Canons, were nonetheless "useful and good to read. However, the Puritans rejected them as not being of divine inspiration and therefore having no authority in the church. Due to this opposition by the Puritans, later editions of the the King James Version in general omitted them. Nearly all modern versions of the Bible exclude the Apocrypha although some editions do include it. 

The books of the Apocrypha are: 1 and 2 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; Additions to Esther; The Wisdom of Solomon; Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach; Baruch; the Letter of Jeremiah; the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men; Susanna; Bel and the Dragon; the Prayer of Manasseh; 1 and 2 Maccabees.
