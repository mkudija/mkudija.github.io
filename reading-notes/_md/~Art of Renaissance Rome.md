## Introduction: Seeing Renaissance Rome
- "Rome is rightly known as the Eternal City, for few other places preserve so many major monuments from so many different ages." (9)
- Much of Rome is either Ancient or Baroque (rather than Renaissance), yet the Raphael rooms and Sistine chapel are "perhaps the supreme expression of Italian Renaissance art." (9)
- Rome is "that great palimpsest of a city where past, present, and eternity collide." (10)
- "Holy Years became an incitement to urban renewal, and conversely, the pilgrims brought money that helped pay for such projects." (11)
- "The [[Renaissance]] began, one might say, with the dawning conviction that the centuries between antiquity and the present had been dark ages. Scholars who embraced this idea, the [[Humanism|humanists]], turned to the surviving literature of antiquity as their guide, believing that a change in patterns of thinking would bring a rebirth, a Renaissance, of classical glory." (13)
- "the seldom-visited choir of Santa Maria del Popolo is a perfect microcosm of the Roman Renaissance." (19)

## Chapter 1: Noble Sparks—The Birth of a Renaissance Ideal
- The Roman Renaissance begins in the 1330s—just prior to the popes departure for Avignon—with Cavallini, de Cambio, and Giotto. (23)
- The Sancta Sanctorum chapel at St. John Lateran was used by Pope Nicholas III to demonstrate his spiritual and temporal power. (24)
- The ancient style of the Arnolfo di Cambio's bronze *St. Peter* is a deliberate means of liking the modern Pope back to St. Peter and the Roman emperors. The toes of the statues are rubbed away by pilgrims over the centuries. (27-28)
- Celestine V (a former hermit) was elected Pope, but resigned after several months, the last to do so until Benedict XVI. Next came Boniface VIII who imagined himself as a new emperor. He established the first Jubilee in 1300, potentially with worldly motives given the money collected from pilgrims. His heavy-handedness against the French contributed to the Avignon papacy and the subsequent decline of Rome. (31-32)


## Chapter 2: The Popes Return and the City is Reborn
- [[Western Schism]]: Gregory XI returns to Rome, Urban VI is elected as his replacement but he disgruntles the French who elect anti-Pope Clement VII in Avignon, resulting in a schism for 40 years until Constance (1414-1418) and Martin V, who set about rebuilding Rome after a century of neglect: "Martin understood that the state of the city of Rome served as a commentary on the state of the Roman papacy, and moreover that the state and status of Rome was always evaluated with an eye to the city's glorious ancient past." (40)
- Inspired by Martin, Cardinals started commissioning works for their titular churches, a sign of confidence in the papacy remaining in Rome. (41)
- Martin's successor Eugenius IV was in exile in Florence for 10 years, during which time Ghiberti's bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery inspired his commission of bronze doors for St. Peter's. (42)
- Nicholas V was the "first humanist Pope" who conceived the Vatican Library and fostered the creation in his court of the polymath Renaissance Man. (45)
- Sant'Agostino has one of the few Gothic-vaulted naves in Rome (55)
- Bessarion and d'Estouteville worked closely together to promote the reunion of East and West, and both commissioned chapels dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, in Santa Maria Maggiore and Santi Apostoli (56)
- Rome "includes in its mix a fascination with history, an awareness of historical distance, and perhaps an attempt to see the past and present as one. These ideas condition much art of the Renaissance, but they were particularly strong in the Renaissance of Rome, the city where all eras coincide as they do nowhere else on earth." (58)


## Chapter 3: *Caput Munti*—Roma Sistina
- The return of Rome as *caput mundi* accelerated under Sixtus
- IV who, despite his nepotism, reinvigorated the city through his Hopsital of Santo Spirito in Sassia and Ponte Sisto bridge, and built the Sistine Chapel (named after him). The paintings alongside the walls of the Sistine Chapel illustrate complementary scenes from the lives of Moses and Christ.
