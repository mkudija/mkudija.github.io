## Introduction 
- "This is in part a dramatic record of a man (and a priest) caught up in a dialogue with God about the things of God." (xviii)
- "Whatever desolation and isolation Hopkins experience at the end of his short life (he died at forty-four), one thing is clear: he was growing steadily closer to the condition of sainthood. In the long view, *that* is the most important fact about the man Hopkins beside which every other fact about him becomes ancillary, including his poetry." (xxi)
- "Hopkins' poems often assume the tripartite structure of the *Spiritual Exercises* of St. Ignatius Loyola: the evocation of a mental image of a physical place, a meditation on the spiritual significance of that image, and a colloquy or personal prayer to God asking for the spiritual good that has been meditated on." (xxii-xxiii)
- His "thought and phrasing are dependent upon the Bible, and especially St. Paul...Hopkins' meaning is rooted deep in the English Catholic literary tradition." (xxiii)
- Hopkins has three essential rhythms (xxiv):
	- First, the conventional strain full o f tension of youth and conversion 
	- Second excited and ecstatic climaxes of the Incarnation (sacramental vision)
	- Third, harsh, weary, or quiet rhythms of the struggle within and the activity of Christ in the self 
- Hopkins was rooted in the English tradition, in the *real* soil of English poetry. 
- His poetry is "new music", combining Milton and Shakespeare and Dryden with Greek and Roman poets and Welsh traditions. It is verb-centered poetry.
