### Chapter 1: The Necessity of Pre-Evangelism
*Chapter 1 in [this email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGrbbwZWlsWCvllngvMbtTLJSnH) from Dan*
- *Pre-evangelism*:
	- A preparation before receiving the Gospel 
	- Conversations that build plausibility for understanding and receiving the Gospel
	- Gradual process of breaking down roadblocks against the Gospel 
	- The task of Sowing (cf. [[Jn-04#v38]])
- [[Thomas A. Tarrants]] read philosophy before converting (cf. *[[~Consumed by Hate Redeemed by Love|Consumed by Hate]]* [[bib]])
- Mars Hill (the *Areopagus*): the hill in Athens where philosophers taught 
- [[C. S. Lewis]]: "The first step is to create, or recover, the sense of guilt...The greatest barrier I have met is the almost total absence from the minds of my audience of any sense of sin." (25)
- Places to start: 
	- pointing out contradictions in their thinking 
	- help them admit that some of what comes from within is not good 
- The pagan has a lot more in common with the Christian than the modern secularist (26)
- "One significant difference between *[[2013-04-03-Mere Christianity|Mere Christianity]]* and most evangelistic books is that the other ones tell readers what to believe and why they should believe it. Lewis's work paves the way for belief by removing obstacles and painting images of what belief is like." (26)
- Aim of this book: help people improve in both roles of evangelism: pre-evangelism (preparing) and evangelism (delivering the message); both are necessary 
- [[C. S. Lewis]] describing his [[Conversion Story]]: "The reason was that in Pagan stories I was prepared to feel the myth as profound and suggestive of meanings beyond my grasp even though I could not say in cold prose what it meant.' Now the story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happenedâ€¦." (28)
