# *For Better* by Tara Parker-Pope

* Compatibility: excessively worrying about compatibility is a danger sign for the relationship. Compatibility is important, but plenty of happy couples aren't ideally compatible, and plenty of compatible couples aren't happy.
* Arguments
    * using we/us is a lot better than you
    * articulate complaints ("I feel" or "I don't like") instead of criticisms ("you always...")
* Women often lose sex drive while nursing 
* They suggest still having sex often (quickie) when you have kids - you get the same chemical benefits even if sex is short
* Women often get more of the share of house work after a baby is born. They need to let the husband take some of the load without micromanaging
* Kids want time with their parents, but having parents who aren't tired and stressed is more important 
* Group couples therapy can have a large positive impact for parents 
* Investing in your relationship is one of the most important things you can do for the wellbeing of your kids 
* Important factors: passion, intimacy, commitment 
* To not get divorced:
    * Marry after 25
    * Marry someone with a college degree
    * Stick it out for at least 10 years
    * Someone with similar interests, background, and values
    * Someone who's parents are still married
* Strategies to stay happy in marriage
    * Celebrate the good times 
    * Know the mathematics of marriage: 5x more positive interactions than negative ones
    * Keep your standards high
    * Don't expect your spouse to make you happy
    * Have sex - even if not in the mood your brain releases chemicals after 5 minutes
    * Reignite romance
