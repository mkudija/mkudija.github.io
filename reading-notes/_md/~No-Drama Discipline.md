## Introduction 
*Rational, low-drama discipline: encouraging cooperation while building a child's brain*
- The word *Discipline* is about teaching and skill-building
- Two goals of no-drama discipline:
	- 1. **Encouraging cooperation**: Stopping bad behavior and promoting good behavior 
	- 2. **Building the brain**: Teaching skills and nurturing the connections in our children's brains that will help them make better decisions and handle themselves well in the future 
- Consequences and punitive reactions are often *counterproductive* to both the short and long term goals 
- Foundation of no-drama discipline: **Connect and redirect** (our relationship with our children should be central)
- Reference: *[[~The Whole-Brain Child|The Whole-Brain Child]]* [[bib]]
- â†’though: parent our children the way the Lord parented Israel in the Old Testament: patiently and focusing on the relationship 

## Chapter 1: ReTHINKING Discipline
_**Summary**: We're not perfect but should try to approach discipline with an intentional philosophy._
- Ask three questions before responding to misbehavior: 
	1. *Why did my child act this way?*
	2. *What lesson do I want to teach at this moment?*
	3. *How can I best teach this lesson?*
- *Can't* vs *Won't* behave: our capacity to behave well fluctuates based on a number of factors (sleep, stress, etc.): we need to account for these in understanding why our children are acting the way they are
- Don't spank and don't put kids in time-out (gives some research: avoid the brain disconnect from wanting the parent to comfort but also wanting to flee from pain)
- We need to show our kids that we always love them, even when they are not behaving well
