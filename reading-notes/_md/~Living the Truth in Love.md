## Preface
*by Janet Smith*
- Pastoral arguments can be more persuasive than theological ones
- "All pastoral approaches must be grounded in an authentic anthropology, and authentic understanding of the human person." (14)

## Introduction

## Total Abandonment to Divine Providence and the Permissive Will of God
*by [[Daniel C. Mattson]] (cf. [[2020-12-23-Abandonment to Divine Providence]])*
- [[Films to Watch]]: *Desire of the Everlasting Hills*
	- "'Thou shalt nots' are guides that really say to man, 'Thou shalt live and flourish and be filled with joy.'...God says no to us because he loves us."
- [[Films to Watch]]: *Into Great Silence*
- "All man-made sexual identities are marked by this same privation of good [cf. *[[~Love and Responsibility]]*], replaced by a faulty distortion of the good of our true sexual nature and orientation. The person, for example, who considers himself [[Transgender|transgendered]] and believes himself to be a female rather than a male as God made him suffers from experiencing the good of his true sexual identity on the level of his psyche. This is a particularly painful form of suffering. Sadly, there are some in the Church today who would support him in his confusion, but they do no good service to him by supporting him in his false understanding of himself." (160)
- "This man needs a reason to hope, and a vision for why God would allow this in his life that counters the prevailing culture that tells him to accept his subjective sense of himself. That vision is the self-sacrificial, selfless, life-giving example of the love Christ showed on the cross." (161)
- He does not use the "language of the world" (cf. [[James Martin, SJ]] in *[[2022-01-25-Building a Bridge#^f686c1]]*): "Only what is true can ultimately be pastoral." (162 cf. 1986 *[Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html)* by the Congregation For The Doctrine Of The Faith)
	- "No one is rightly called gay, lesbian, or any other letter in the alphabet soup of sexual identities. These labels stem from an impoverished and polluted view of human sexuality.", and "they do not describe persons with the fullness and richness that the Church recognizes and respects in every man or woman. Instead, 'gay' and 'lesbian' are often cultural definitions for people and movements that have accepted homosexual acts and behaviors as morally good." (165, second part from *[Pastoral Ministry to Young People with Same-Sex Attraction](https://truthandlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ministry-ssa_en.pdf)* from the Episcopal Commission for Doctrine of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops)
	- See also 2006 *[Ministry to Persons with a Homosexual Inclination: Guidelines for Pastoral Care](https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/homosexuality/upload/minstry-persons-homosexual-inclination-2006.pdf)* from USCCB
- [[Joseph Ratzinger|Pope Benedict XVI]]: "To disregard [the nature of the human being as man and woman] would be the self-destruction of man himself, and hence the destruction of God's own work." (164 [Christmas greetings to the members of the Roman Curia and Prelature (December 22, 2008)](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2008/december/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20081222_curia-romana.html))
- "God brings loneliness into our lives so that we will know that only he, and he alone, can satisfy us." (169)
- The section **Abandonment in the Face of Addictions** is a beautiful meditation on [[Chastity]]:
	- [[Thomas Merton]] in *Life and Holiness*: "We become saints not by violently overcoming our own weakness, but by letting the Lord give us the strength and purity of his Spirit in exchange for our weakness and misery."
	- Our continued struggles with [[Chastity]] can help us not fall into the larger sin of [[Pride]], as [[C. S. Lewis]] observes in *The Problem of Pain*: "The creature's illusion of self-sufficiency must, for the creature's sake, be shattered...The dangers of apparent self-sufficiency explain why Our Lord regards the vices of the feckless and dissipated so much more leniently than the vices that lead to worldly success. Prostitutes are in no danger of finding their present life so satisfactory that they cannot turn to God: the proud, the avaricious, the self-righteous, are in that danger."
	- Blessed Columba Marmion in *Union with God*: "Do not let yourself be discouraged by your miseries; the Good God leaves you some miseries to convince you thoroughly that you can do nothing. He does not wish us to be able to attribute to ourselves whatever good we can accomplish."
	- "In our battle for chastity, the victory is God's, and God's alone." (172)
