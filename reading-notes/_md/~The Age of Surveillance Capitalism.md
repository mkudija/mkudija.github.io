>The **second** reason I don’t use Canvas is because of my concerns about its harvesting of our data. I support, though not without reservations, the system of political economy that we call capitalism, but I strongly protest against what Shoshana Zuboff, in one of the most important books of recent years, calls [“surveillance capitalism.”](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism/lRqrDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) Canvas sucks up all our data and does with it more-or-less whatever it wants, and I don’t approve of that as an individual user and also because I think it is inconsistent with the character of real education. We’re here to learn together, not to provide data for a company to monetize.
