### Book V
- "Authority is not given to you to order the hour of your death." (129) 

### Book VI
- "In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to hold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him. The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command" (186)
- "The beauty of it smote his heart...in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for every beyond its reach." (211)
- "Well, if that is the job then I must do it." (225)
- "Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil." (339)
