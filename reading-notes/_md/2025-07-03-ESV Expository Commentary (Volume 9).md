<div class="note"> <p>On John's Prologue: "Like a symphony studied centuries after its creation, its melodies and harmonies charm those who hear only the surface, while astounding those who explore its depths." (23)</p> </div> 

The ESV is one of the translations I most frequently read and study from,[^esv] so I was excited to learn about the *ESV Expository Commentary*. 

[^esv]: See *[[2023-05-13-Bible Translation & the Making of the ESV Catholic Edition|Bible Translation & the Making of the ESV Catholic Edition]]* for an excellent overview. 

I chose to start with the commentary of Dr. James M. Hamilton Jr. on John in Volume 9 to shed some light on a question of mine that has been developing for some time: how do the best Reformed or Evangelical scholars interpret John 6 in relation to the Eucharist? 

But let's not get ahead of ourselves: before getting into those details, Dr. Hamilton gives a wonderful introduction to the Gospel of John. He affirms the tradition that the Apostle John, the son of Zebedee, wrote the Gospel that bears his name in all manuscript evidence. This type of defense is—regrettably— important given modern skepticism, despite the massively more substantial historical and manuscript evidence we have for the New Testament than many other contemporary historical writings. Hamilton also identifies John's biblical worldview as a key to understanding his writing, and emphasizes how the Fourth Gospel must be read in light of the Old Testament story it fulfills for either to make sense, a point also emphasized by the Second Vatican Council in its document of Divine Revelation, *Dei Verbum*. 

Next, Hamilton's commentary on John's Prologue is a fitting ode to perhaps the most majestic opening of any written work. I never tire of John's opening, and Hamilton's analogy is fitting: it is a diamond that might be "admired from various angles" (36). 

Returning to the question of John 6, as someone who was raised with a Catholic understanding of Christ's real presence in the Eucharist, this text is quite plainly Eucharistic to me: "*the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh*" (v51), "*unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you*" (v53), and "*whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him*" (v56). How is this interpreted, then, if not in a Eucharistic sense? 

The two main threads of Hamilton's interpretation I gather are these: flesh connected to the cross, and a focus on spiritual needs. First he draws a connection from "flesh" to, not the Eucharist, but the sacrifice of Christ's flesh on the cross. Connecting John 6:53 to Hebrews 10:20, he states: "Jesus gives his flesh for the life of the world in the sense that he gives himself up to be crucified on behalf of sinners" (141). He further emphasizes the *symbolic* nature of Christ's flesh: "Jesus transformed the symbol [of the unleavened bread], replacing the celebration of the Passover with the celebration of the cross" (141, footnote 27). 

Second he focuses on Jesus fulfilling our *spiritual* needs over our *material* needs, resulting in a  symbolic reading of feeding on Christ's flesh and blood. This is first hinted at earlier in 6:22-40 when the crowd wants to be fed again, seeking the merely physical when Jesus further offers spiritual nourishment. In relation to Jesus giving us his body and blood to feed upon, Hamilton notes that "the feeding on Jesus in view here is not a cannibalistic feeding on his physical body but a spiritual feeding, a trusting in his death and resurrection that inaugurates the new covenant. The spiritual nourishment Jesus speaks of here is enjoyed by believers who celebrate the Lord's Supper" (143). 

Hamilton does more explicitly rule out a literal interpretation of this passage:
>Jesus is obviously not calling people to eat his literal body and drink his literal blood. Christians are not cannibals. Jesus does not want Christians to be cannibals. Jesus *is* calling people to come to him and believe what he says. Believing Jesus includes trusting that his death on the cross, the crucifixion of his flesh, propitiated the Father's wrath and made forgiveness possible. Believing Jesus includes trusting that being united to him by faith brings one into a new relationship with the Father, a new covenant in his blood. (142)

Ultimately, Hamilton's interpretation is a symbolic understanding rooted in our *belief*, *trust*, and *faith* in Christ's atoning work on the cross. Contrast this with a sacramental Catholic view as articulated by Bergsma that "the plain sense of the New Testament is that the Eucharist is Jesus' body (*[[2025-03-17-Jesus and the Jubilee|Jesus and the Jubilee-The Biblical Roots of the Year of God’s Favor]]*, 150).[^bergsma]

[^bergsma]: Bergsma continues: "I quickly went back and scanned all the New Testament passages about the Eucharist, like the Institution Narratives in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Bread of Life Discourse in John 6, and Paul's teaching in 1 Corinthians 10-11, and it struck me as if for the first time that the plain sense of all these Scriptures was simply that the Eucharist was Jesus's body, or flesh. Then I scanned the teaching of the other Church Fathers on the Eucharist, thinking, "Maybe Ignatius is just an exception." Guess what? He's not an exception! I could quote many Fathers, but let the famous St. Augustine, so revered by Lutherans and Calvinists, speak for himself. Augustine said that Jesus held himself in his own hands at the Last Supper, and furthermore, it is not a sin to worship the Eucharist, but it is a sin *not* to worship it!" (*[[2025-03-17-Jesus and the Jubilee|Jesus and the Jubilee-The Biblical Roots of the Year of God’s Favor]]*, 150)

One linguistic detail Hamilton does not mention in his commentary is how John records a change in Jesus' vocabulary to stress the physical *eating* of his body. He shifts from <strong style="color: #549F5B; ">eats</strong> (<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm" target="_blank">phago / φάγω</a></em> "to eat {literally or figuratively}") before the crowd questions him as to how they can eat his flesh, to <strong style="color: #BD483E; ">feeds</strong> (<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5176.htm" target="_blank">trógó / τρώγω</a></em> "to gnaw or chew") in Jesus' response. Given a chance to correct their interpretation of literally eating his flesh and drink his blood, Jesus chooses instead to double down and emphasize the physical nature of the eating he offers. A number of commentaries I referenced also emphasize this point,[^other] and the ESV translation *does indeed* pick up on this shift of vocabulary in the Greek:[^rsv]

<blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">48</strong>I am the bread of life. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">49</strong>Your fathers <strong style="color: #549F5B; ">ate</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm" target="_blank">ἔφαγον</a></em>] the manna in the wilderness, and they died. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">50</strong>This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may <strong style="color: #549F5B; ">eat</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm" target="_blank">φάγῃ</a></em>] of it and not die. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">51</strong>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone <strong style="color: #549F5B; ">eats</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm" target="_blank">φάγῃ</a></em>] of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”<br>
<strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">52</strong>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to <strong style="color: #549F5B; ">eat</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm" target="_blank">φαγεῖν</a></em>]?” <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">53</strong>So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you <strong style="color: #549F5B; ">eat</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm" target="_blank">φάγητε</a></em>] the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">54</strong>Whoever <strong style="color: #BD483E; ">feeds</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5176.htm" target="_blank">τρώγων</a></em>] on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">55</strong>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">56</strong>Whoever <strong style="color: #BD483E; ">feeds</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5176.htm" target="_blank">τρώγων</a></em>] on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">57</strong>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever <strong style="color: #BD483E; ">feeds</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5176.htm" target="_blank">τρώγων</a></em>] on me, he also will live because of me. <strong style="color: #666; font-size: 75%; vertical-align: top">58</strong>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers <strong style="color: #549F5B; ">ate</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm" target="_blank">ἔφαγον</a></em>], and died. Whoever <strong style="color: #BD483E; ">feeds</strong> [<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/5176.htm" target="_blank">τρώγων</a></em>] on this bread will live forever.”<br>–<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/6.htm" target="_blank">John 6:48-50</a>, <em>English Standard Version</em></blockquote>


[^other]: For example, see:<br>‣From the *[[~Ignatius Catholic Study Bible|Ignatius Catholic Study Bible]]* Word Study on 1901: *Trōgō*, [τρώγω](https://biblehub.com/greek/5176.htm) (Gk.): A verb meaning 'chew' or 'gnaw'. It is used five times in the Fourth Gospel and only once elsewhere in the NT. Greek literature used it to describe the feeding of animals such as mules, pigs, and cattle, and in some cases for human eating. In John, the verb is used four times in the second half of the Bread of Life discourse (Jn 6:54, 56, 57, 58). This marks a noticeable shift in Jesus' teaching, which up until Jn 6:54 made use of a more common verb for eating (Gk. *esthiō*, [ἐσθίω](https://biblehub.com/greek/2068.htm), Jn 6:49, 50, 51, 53). The change in vocabulary marks a change of focus and emphasis, from the necessity of faith to the consumption of the Eucharist. The graphic and almost crude connotation of this verb thus adds greater force to the repetition of his words: he demands we express our faith by eating, in a real and physical way, his life-giving flesh in the sacrament."<br>‣[[Bishop Barron]]'s commentary on John 6:48-66 in the *[[~Word on Fire Bible Gospels|Word on Fire Bible-The Gospels]]*: "The Greek term translated here by 'eat' is not the usual *phagein* ([φάγω](https://biblehub.com/greek/5315.htm)), but rather *trogein*, a word customarily used to describe the way animals devour their food. We might render it 'gnaw' or 'chomp'. Therefore, to those who are revolted by the realism of his language, Jesus says, essentially, 'Unless you gnaw on my flesh...you have no life in you." (501)

[^rsv]: This is an example of where the ESV is truer to the original Greek than both the RSV2CE (retains "eats" in all four locations) and the NABRE (uses "feeds" in 6:57, but retains "eats" in the remaining three locations, with a footnote on 6:54–58 Eats: the verb used in these verses is not the classical Greek verb used of human eating, but that of animal eating: “munch,” “gnaw.” This may be part of John’s emphasis on the reality of the flesh and blood of Jesus (cf. Jn 6:55), but the same verb eventually became the ordinary verb in Greek meaning “eat.”)


A survey of a few other resources include the following comments on John 6 in relation to the Eucharist:
- From the *[[~Ignatius Catholic Study Bible|Ignatius Catholic Study Bible]]* note on John 6:53: "Jesus is speaking literally and sacramentally. If he were speaking metaphorically or figuratively, his words would echo a Hebrew idiom where consuming flesh and blood refers to the brutalities of War (Deut 32:42; Ezek 39:17-18)" (1901).
- The *[[~Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture New Testament Set|Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture]]* sees the same connection between the "flesh" and the cross, and connects this to the Eucharist: "The same flesh and blood offered by Christ to the Father on the cross and then resurrected to glory is given to us in the Eucharist. By consuming Christ's glorified flesh and blood in the Eucharist, we receive eternal life and will also share in his resurrection" (129). This commentary also notes the change in vocabulary in the Greek for "to eat".
- The *[[~Gospels and Acts|Navarre Bible]]* notes the spiritual nature of Jesus offering his flesh to us: "In the same way as bodily food is necessary for life on earth, Holy Communion is necessary for maintaining the life of the soul, which is why the Church exhorts us to receive this sacrament frequently" (596).
- Aquinas indicates how the Eucharist *communicates* Christ: "Yet it was especially suitable that he institute in his own person this sacrament, in which his body and blood are communicated. Hence he himself says: *the bread that I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh*" (*[[~Thomas Aquinas-Selected Commentaries on the New Testament|Thomas Aquinas-Selected Commentaries on the New Testament]]*, 230). Thomas, elsewhere commenting on Hebrews 2:14, cites John 5 and [[St. John Chrysostom]]: "By flesh and blood can also be understood the flesh and blood of Christ according to the statement *he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood* (John 6:55), of which *the children*, i.e., the apostles, partook at the last supper and of which Christ partook, as Chrysostom expressly says about Matthew 26: *He drank his own blood*" (ibid. 123; cf. John Chrysostom, *Homilies on the Gospel of Saint Matthew* 82).
- I published these reflections on July 3, the feast of Saint Thomas, Apostle. The [[~Roman Missal|Prayer after Communion]] for this feast touches on these themes of Eucharist and faith:

>O God, as we truly receive in this Sacrament 
>the Body of your Only Begotten Son, 
>grant, we pray, that we may recognize him 
>with the Apostle Thomas by faith 
>as our Lord and our God 
>and proclaim him by our deeds and by our life. 
>Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.


After Dr. Hamilton's exposition that focuses on a primarily symbolic interpretation of John 6 that emphasizes belief, I am left somewhat confused by his closing that seems to endorse a more literal, sacramental reading, though perhaps this is just a matter of relative emphasis: "There is nothing we need Jesus to give us more than what he provides: himself...By eating his flesh and drinking his blood, we abide in him" (145). The term "Lord's Supper" is used throughout this exposition, and I am aware that this is a term commonly used in the Evangelical tradition to refer to the communal fulfillment of Jesus' command to *"do this in remembrance of me"*, whether it is understood sacramentally or only as a symbol. I suspect there is a lot of Reformed theological context surrounding the term "Lord's Supper" that I have yet to learn, just as there is indeed a detailed theological tradition surrounding the word "Eucharist". This is an opportunity for me to learn more, in the spirit of *[[2024-11-26-Evangelicals and Catholics Together|Evangelicals and Catholics Together]]*. With appreciation for deeper understanding to be had by all, Dr. Hamilton's closing remarks on this section ring true for every believer: "there is nothing more satisfying than what Jesus gives us: himself" (145).

I'll close this reflection on the *ESV Expository Commentary* on John by affirming how spiritually enriching it was for me to consider Dr. Hamilton's exposition, which spurred me to revisit some other commentaries as well. The majesty of John's Gospel is a deep well to drink from, and Dr. Hamilton's exposition does justice to an incomparable text while continually drawing his readers back to the worship of its ultimate author: "To encounter Jesus in John is to encounter one who inspires us to thank and praise God. The Gospel of John provokes the worship of Jesus" (26). I am confident I will continue to refer to this commentary on John, and I am looking forward to exploring more of the *ESV Expository Commentary* series.

# John 
*James M. Hamilton Jr.*
## Introduction to John 
- Mark starts with John the Baptist. Luke starts with Elizabeth and Zechariah. Matthew starts with Abraham. John reaches all the way back to the beginning, evoking the opening words of Genesis. (19)
- There is no observed manuscript variation in the title "The Gospel according to John" or shortened "According to John". (19-20)
- "Western culture has suffered from a widespread fad in scholarship involving profound skepticism about authors and authorship...The evidence, however, points to the conclusion that John son of Zebedee wrote the Fourth Gospel. Those positing a different author often set aside primary source data and reliable early testimony in favor of elaborate theories reflecting deep suspicion of the evidence in our possession. No manuscript attributes the Fourth Gospel to anyone other than John." (20)
- "John states the reason he wrote in 20:31: 'That you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.' John no doubt wanted unbelievers to *start* believing and believers to *continue* believing." (21)
- "Every aspect of John's worldview has been quarried, hewn, sculpted, and textured by Scripture. That is to say, John was a biblical theologian. John's heart, mind, and soul were enlivened by the way Jesus taught him to understand the OT's accounts of how God created and redeemed, covenanted and promised...The best phrase for describing the kind of literature found in the Gospel of John is *biblical narrative*." (21)
	- John writes from the same worldview as the authors of the OT, and his narrative is much more like that than Greek biographies. The evangelists write in Greek to fulfill Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations. "The commentary that follows seeks to understand how John intended the words he used to activate a dynamic between his narrative and the OT, a dynamic that presents Jesus as the culmination, fulfillment, resolution, and realization of everything anticipated in the Law and the Prophets." (22)
- "John's Gospel and the OT must be read in light of each other, each expositing and informing the other." (22, cf. *[[2022-12-03-Dei Verbum#^b3aa81]]*)
- Hamilton's commentary is organized around John's contributions to: story, symbol, truth, worship, culture, way of life. (23ff)
- "So much of what John says is tantalizingly brief, and many things are left unexplored." (23)
- "John tells the story of Jesus such that his Gospel is *both* a straightforward historical narrative *and* a pervasively allusive biblical-theological account whose resonance with the OT is so full and sophisticated that it takes its place as one of the great achievements of human art....Like a symphony studied centuries after its creation, its melodies and harmonies charm those who hear only the surface, while astounding those who explore its depths." (23)
- John highlights Jesus in relation to the Passover and Tabernacles (24). "Israel's prophets, guided by the institution of the feasts, used the historical acts of God celebrated in the symbols to depict the way God would save his people in the future." (25)
- "To encounter Jesus in John is to encounter one who inspires us to thank and praise God. The Gospel of John provokes the worship of Jesus." (26)

## John 1:1-18
- "Could there be a more profound opening to a book than the one to John's Gospel?" (35)
- John 1:1-18 has a *chiastic* structure, with Jesus' rejection by the world, but reception by those born of God in the middle. (35)
- "The Word was *with* God and the Word *was* God. Something so beautiful and glorious, so complex and simple, must be admired. John is like a man holding out a diamond to a viewer who, after the initial awe-inspiring presentation, begins to turn the stone so that all its facets might be admired from various angles." (36)
- "John declares the mystery of the Trinity in the fewest words possible. Could more be stated with less? These two verses, John 1:1-2, invite us to contemplation and meditation. We must repeat these statements until they are [[Memorize Scripture|etched]] on our minds, and ponder them, read about them, and respond to them by worshiping the incomparable God these words describe." (36)
- John uses *Logos*, the Word, to refer to Genesis and how God created by speaking. (37)
- "John here asserts that creation and life came from God's direct activity in Christ. This excludes the possibility of a random process of natural selection in which life simply happened. There can be no more rapprochement between belief that God created the world and belief in [[evolution]] than there could be between Churchill and Hitler, fidelity and adultery, or ultimate significance and morose nihilism." (37)
- [[Jn-01#v14]]: "dwelt among us" could just as well be rendered "tabernacled among us" since John uses the cognate verb for the noun used in the Septuagint to refer to the tabernacle. (40)

## John 6:22-40
- [[Typology]]: Moses and Jesus both went up onto the mountain by themselves; as Moses parted the Red Sea, so Jesus walked across the water of Galilee (131)
- The crowd seeks Jesus to fulfill their needs (good), but the wrong needs (merely physical food) (132)
- Distinction between material and physical needs: "This crowd with which Jesus interacts has been so distracted by their physical needs that Jesus has had some difficulty getting them to understand what he is telling them about their spiritual need." (134)
	- →*Can't Jesus fulfill both our spiritual needs **and** our physical needs?* 
- Note the strong emphasis on the Father's will in 6:37, 38, 39, and 40 (135)
- Strong view of [[Predestination]]:
	- "If the Father has given someone to Jesus ,that person is *eternally* secure." (135)
	- "If we look to Jesus and believe, it means that in eternity past the Father ordained that we would belong to Jesus...Our redemption is as certain as our Redeemer is reliable." (136)
	- Predestination is used to explain the behavior of those in 6:66: "In response, those not given to Jesus by the Father begin to drift away..." (144)

## John 6:41-71
- "Why would Jesus make such a shocking statement?...Once again Jesus has used something physical to teach a spiritual truth." (141)
- Connects "flesh" not to the Eucharist, but to the sacrifice of his flesh on the cross, connecting [[Jn-06#v53]] to [[Heb-10#v20]]: "Jesus gives his flesh for the life of the world in the sense that he gives himself up to be crucified on behalf of sinners" (141). "That unleavened bread would commemorate something about the new exodus, namely, the body of Jesus broken for his people. Jesus transformed the symbol, replacing the celebration of the Passover with the celebration of the cross." (141 footnote 27)
- "Jesus is obviously not calling people to eat his literal body and drink his literal blood. Christians are not cannibals. Jesus does not want Christians to be cannibals. Jesus *is* calling people to come to him and believe what he says. Believing Jesus includes trusting that his death on the cross, the crucifixion of his flesh, propitiated the Father's wrath and made forgiveness possible. Believing Jesus includes trusting that being united to him by faith brings one into a new relationship with the Father, a new covenant in his blood." (142)
- "'Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him' (6:56). Those who eat the Lord's Supper in remembrance and proclamation of Jesus' death in their place, who drink the cup in celebration of the new covenant into which Jesus has brought us with the Father—these people *abide* in Jesus and he in them. The presence of Christ is *mediated* to us and *maintained* among us as we believe his word and enjoy what he has given us in the celebration of the Lord's Supper." (142)
- "The feeding on Jesus in view here is not a cannibalistic feeding on his physical body but a spiritual feeding, a trusting in his death and resurrection that inaugurates the new covenant. The spiritual nourishment Jesus speaks of here is enjoyed by believers who celebrate the Lord's Supper." (143)
- "There is nothing we need Jesus to give us more than what he provides: himself. There is nothing more precious than what Jesus gives us: himself. There is nothing more able to save than what Jesus gives us: himself. There is nothing more satisfying than what Jesus gives us: himself. He is the Bread of Life. He has life in himself. By eating his flesh and drinking his blood, we abide in him. The Father gave life to Jesus, and he gives life to us." (145)

## John 17:9-26
- "This unity between the members of the Godhead is the basis for the unity Jesus asks the Father to create among his followers: "that they may be one, even as we are one ([[Jn-17#v11]])." (262)
- "In verses 14-16 Jesus speaks of what distinguishes his people from the world: the word of God. By giving his people the word, Jesus has created and unworldly way of thinking, living, and being for his followers." (263)
- "Jesus states the tremendously important purpose of the unity of those who believe: 'that the world may believe that you have sent me' (v. 21c). Jesus expects the unworldly unity of his followers to have an evangelistic impact on the unbelieving world. This means that Jesus expects the unity of the church to be convincing to the world." (264)
- Response: "Are we putting ourselves in position for the Word to do its work in our lives? Are we doing our part to contribute to the unity of the church?" (266)
