## Chapter 7: Keep It Simple

## Chapter 8: Asset Allocation

# Part II: Follow-Through Strategies to Keep You on Target
## Chapter 17: Track Your Progress and Rebalance When Necessary
- Select your asset allocation, and then rebalance to maintain that on a regular cadence 

## Chapter 18: Tune Out the "Noise"
- Avoid the distractions of financial media that might steer you away from your plan 
- Research by reading good books and information online 

## Chapter 19: Mastering Your Investments Means Mastering Your Emotions
- Behavioral economics: build process to overcome your natural greed and fear 
- **Recency bias.** Never assume today's results predict tomorrow's. It's a changing world.
- **Overconfidence**. No one can consistently predict short-term movements in the market. This means you and/or the person investing your money.
- **Loss aversion**. Be a risk manager instead of a risk avoider. Believing you are avoiding risk can be a costly illusion.
- **Paralysis by analysis**. Every day you don't invest is a day less you'll have the power of compounding working for you. Put together an intelligent investment plan and get started. If you need help, seek out a good financial planner to assist you.
- **The endowment effect**. Just because you own it, or are a part of it, doesn't automatically mean it's worth more. Get an objective evaluation. Invest no more than 10 percent of your portfolio in your employer's stock.
- Mental accounting. Remember that all money spends the same, regardless of where it comes from. Money already spent is a sunk cost and should play no part in making future decisions.
- **Anchoring**. Holding out until you get your price to sell an investment is playing a fool's game. So is blindly assuming that your financial person is doing a great job without getting an objective reading of what's really going on. Get a second opinion.
- **Financial negligence**. Take the time to learn the basics of sound invest-ing. It's really pretty simple stuff. Knowing it can make the difference between having a life of poverty or one of prosperity.

## Chapter 20: Making Your Money Last Longer Than You Do
- You can't predict how much money you will need in retirement

## Chapter 21: Protect Your Assets by Being Well-Insured

- Only insure against bit catastrophes you can't pay for out of pocket (the cheapest insurance is self-insurance) 
- Carry the largest deductibles you can afford 
- Only buy coverage from high-rated insurance companies 

## Chapter 22: Passing It One When You Pass On
- Have a will, living trust, power of attorney, advance health care directive 

## Chapter 23: You Can Do It
- Choose and live a sound financial lifestyle 
- Start to save early and invest regularly 
- Know the basics of stocks, bonds, ETFs. Don't invest in things you don't understand
- Estimate how much you will need for retirement to keep yourself on track 
- Invest in low-cost index funds
