## Introduction
- Virtues of the [[historical-critical method]] of Biblical scholarship:
	- It takes seriously how the Bible is grounded in history 
	- It blocks the temptation to "hermeneutical whimsy", i.e. irresponsibly speculative interpretations of biblical texts
	- Respects the incarnational principle of God cooperating with his creatures (human authors) to write the Bible by stressing the role of the human author
- Limitations of the [[historical-critical method]] of Biblical scholarship:
	- Loses sight of God as the principal author of the Bible by stressing the role of the human author 
	- Eliminates the coherence of the Bible as a whole by atomizing individual books 
		- Instead, look to the "canonical approach" that gives a unified reading of the Bible as a whole by scholars such as [[N.T. Wright]]
	- Relegates the Bible to the past rather than focusing on its universal value 
	- Sees the theological tradition as a distorting overlay rather than a clarifying lens (a set of *[[sola scriptura]]* assumptions)
		- Instead, look to [[John Henry Newman|Newman]]: theology represents a development and a clarification of themes and ideas present in the scriptural texts (xi, cf. *[[~An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine|An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine]]* [[bib]])
- This commentary then:
	- Not a work of historical criticism, but draws upon the findings of that method 
	- Is a "theological interpretation"
	- Assumes throughout that the prime author of the Scriptures is the Holy Spirit 
	- Takes for granted a deep coherence between the various biblical texts 
	- Respects the spiritual and theological tradition 
	- Assumes a mutually enhancing relationship between doctrine and exegesis (with [[Joseph Ratzinger|Ratzinger]])
	- Reads the Old Testament consistently in light of Christ ([[St. Augustine|Augustine]]'s "the New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New", cf. *[[2022-12-03-Dei Verbum|Dei Verbum]]* 16 and [[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 129)


## [[Genesis]]
_**Summary**: God is other and noncompetitive._
- Genre is *theological poetry*: makes claims that have scientific and philosophical implications, but purpose is not scientific nor philosophical (1)
- Time itself is a creature (2)
- "To be in right relation to God is to acknowledge one's total dependence upon him; to be in sin is to seek to stand somewhere apart from him, to find some place where or some time when he is not." (2)
- We learn a lot about God's nature because he is *creator* (2)
	- [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]: God as *ipsum esse* (to-be itself); God's very nature is to be
	- God is noncompetitive vis-à-vis his creation 
	- God creates not through violence but through speech: his knowledge is active and creative, and all of creation is marked by intelligibility
- The [[Parataxis]] of [[Gn-01|Genesis 1]] creates a stately procession of creation, like a liturgical procession of ministers; human beings are last because they lead the praise (5)
- All are creatures so nothing is to be worshipped except God ([[St. Augustine|Augustine]] says in *[[~Confessions|The Confessions]]* that the essence of sin is turning from the Creator to creatures). "The entire scriptural story centers around this theme of right versus errant worship." (6)
- God *rests* to savor what he has made: Aquinas (in *[[2021-08-12-Summa Theologiae|Summa Theologiae]]* 1-2.3.4) says that the two basic moves of the will are to seek the absent good and to rest in the possessed good (6-7)
- Because the river flows out of Eden, it is a mountain, a place of encounter between God and man (7)
- Punishments as natural consequences: "God's punishments are not expressions of personal vengeance; they are best read as the consequences that follow naturally from sin...In God, all things hold together; apart from God, they disintegrate." (11)
- Noah's ark is an anticipation of the temple, and a symbol of the Church (15); his first act upon landing is to offer sacrifice to the Lord (16)
- Tower of Babel: "God wants humans to be fully alive, but the divine life cannot, even in principle, be seized; it can only be received as a gift." (17)
- Unlikely birth as a gift (Isaac in this case) is a common theme in the Bible signaling the primacy of grace and importance of trust in divine providence (21)
- Sacrifice of Isaac: we must recognize how truly awful it is, but also how there is no proper communion with God without sacrifice and the lower goods of the world have to be sacrificed to God in the measure that they have come to take the place of God (23)
- The conflict between Jacob and Esau leads to the division of Israel and Judah (25)
- Jacob's ladder is a "master metaphor for the whole of Israelite life: covenant, prophecy, temple, liturgy, sacrifice—all of it will function as a conduit between God and the world he is endeavoring to save"...Jesus is the definitive ladder between heaven and earth (27)
- Jacob is frustrated with his additional 7 years of service for Laban, but God is accomplishing his own purpose and giving Jacob more than he could have imagined in his twelve sons for the twelve tribes of Israel (29)
- The story of [[Joseph (OT)]] is "one of the most beautifully told, psychologically profound, and theologically illuminating narratives" → read Thomas Mann's *[[~Joseph and His Brothers|Joseph and His Brothers]]* (31-32). His lessons for us include: power is spiritually valid only when it remains tied to truth and love (35), and Israel is meant not for itself but for the whole world (35), and God permits evils within his creation in order to make possible certain good that could not have come about in any other way (38)


## [[Exodus]]
_**Summary**: The God of Israel delivers his people from bondage and brings them to a place of freedom. Political liberation is a metaphor for spiritual liberation from sin and death._
- The burning bush on fire but not consumed illustrates the nonviolent and noncompetitive nature of God toward his creation (43); "The God of the burning bush cannot be grasped, but by the same token, he cannot be avoided." (44)
- "I Am Who I Am" conveys the qualitative difference between the divine manner of existing and anything other than God (45)
- God's signs against Pharaoh attack the false Egyptian God's (48)
- Manna: God sustains us physically, but his ultimate purpose is to sustain us spiritually (52)
- Israel is given the Law for the sake of the world: set apart for the sake of the whole (55)
- The [[Ten Commandments]] (57)
	- The first and most important commandment: "I am the Lord your God"...Every other form of moral and spiritual dysfunction Follows from this most fundamental distortion, and the necessary first move is the dethronement of false gods.
