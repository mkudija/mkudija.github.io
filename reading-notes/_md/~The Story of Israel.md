## Introduction
- Virtues of the [[historical-critical method]] of Biblical scholarship:
	- It takes seriously how the Bible is grounded in history 
	- It blocks the temptation to "hermeneutical whimsy", i.e. irresponsibly speculative interpretations of biblical texts
	- Respects the incarnational principle of God cooperating with his creatures (human authors) to write the Bible by stressing the role of the human author
- Limitations of the [[historical-critical method]] of Biblical scholarship:
	- Loses sight of God as the principal author of the Bible by stressing the role of the human author 
	- Eliminates the coherence of the Bible as a whole by atomizing individual books 
		- Instead, look to the "canonical approach" that gives a unified reading of the Bible as a whole by scholars such as [[N.T. Wright]]
	- Relegates the Bible to the past rather than focusing on its universal value 
	- Sees the theological tradition as a distorting overlay rather than a clarifying lens (a set of *[[sola scriptura]]* assumptions)
		- Instead, look to [[John Henry Newman|Newman]]: theology represents a development and a clarification of themes and ideas present in the scriptural texts (xi, cf. *[[~An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine|An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine]]* [[bib]])
- This commentary then:
	- Not a work of historical criticism, but draws upon the findings of that method 
	- Is a "theological interpretation"
	- Assumes throughout that the prime author of the Scriptures is the Holy Spirit 
	- Takes for granted a deep coherence between the various biblical texts 
	- Respects the spiritual and theological tradition 
	- Assumes a mutually enhancing relationship between doctrine and exegesis (with [[Joseph Ratzinger|Ratzinger]])
	- Reads the Old Testament consistently in light of Christ ([[St. Augustine|Augustine]]'s "the New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New", cf. *[[2022-12-03-Dei Verbum|Dei Verbum]]* 16 and [[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 129)
