### 1st Sunday of Lent 
- Lent is a time of warfare. Through our Lenten practices o prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, we do battle with the power of the devil in our lives, and with God's grace, defeat him decisively. (67)
- [[Dt-26#v4]]-10: The first readings of the Sundays of Lent tell us the story of salvation history. Today reminds us of the importance of memory in worship: [[~Memory and Identity|memory creates identity]] (68-69)
- [[Ps-91]] is the quintissential spiritual warfare psalm (70)


### 5th Sunday in Ordinary Time 
- "Fishers of men" in [[Lk-05#v10]] harkens back to [[Jer-16#v16]]

### 6th Sunday in Ordinary Time 
- [[Examination of Conscience]] (243)
	- Could the measure of success or prosperity I enjoy actually be due to the fact that I do not publicly identify with Jesus but simply act and speak like the rest of the world?
	- On the other hand, could the sorrows and afflictions I endure actually be signs of God's love and the reward he has in store for me in the life to come?
	- Do I fall into the trap of evaluating my life and the lives of others based on material goods and other physical signs of health and prosperity?
	- Finally, am I a man or woman who trusts in the LoRD, who delights in his law, and who meditates on his Word day and night? If not, what am I trusting in?
