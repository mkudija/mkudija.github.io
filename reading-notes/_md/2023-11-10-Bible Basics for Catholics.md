## Introduction 
- Goal of this book: show you the basic overall "big picture" of the Bible 
- Use stick figures to remember the series of biblical covenants
- A **covenant** is a legal way to make someone a part of your family (4), or "the extension of kinship by oath" (163)—adoption and marriage are examples
- The **mediator** is a person who represents groups of people involved in a covenant: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus 
- Covenants take place on mountaintops, where we feel closer to God and can see the world in context 

## Chapter 1: The Covenant with Adam
- Adam was a model for us and the meaning of his life remains the purpose of our lives (10)
- Our first image is the image of the temple of creation (19)
- Being made in God's "image and likeness" means to be a son—*divine filiation* (20)
- The arrival of woman is a high point in God's creation, and the woman brings out the best in the man (24)
- Adam's identity in Genesis 1-2: firstborn son, king, priest, prophet, bridegroom (25)
	- We are also called to be *priest* (offer sacrifice of our own life), *prophet* (speak God's word), and *king* (master self so as to not be a slave to sin)
- God clothing Adam and Eve in the skin of a dead lamb in the garden foreshadows the Lamb of God clothing humans in his righteousness (36)

## Chapter 2: The Covenant with Noah
- The language of Noah's covenant recalls Genesis 1 and is a renewal of the covenant with Adam—the flood is a re-creation (40)
- The themes of Noah's fall are familiar: consumption of fruit, nakedness, shame, curse. Sin has infected every person (44)

## Chapter 3: The Covenant with Abraham
- Abraham is not chosen for his own sake. He is chosen so that he can bless the rest of the human family (45)
- God makes a "covenant between the pieces" with Abraham, meaning something to the effect of "if I do not keep my covenant commitments, may I be killed like these animals" (49)
- God is coming down to Abraham's level: *divine condescension* (49)
- The sacrifice of Isaac on the mountain is a premonition of Christ's sacrifice (54), where "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son" (55, cf. [[Gn-22#v8]])

## Chapter 4: The Covenant with Moses
- The ten plagues are a "battle of the gods" where the Lord God shows his reality over the false gods of Egypt (68)
- At Sinai God is adopting Israel as his "firstborn son." The [[Ten Commandments]] are the family rules governing our relationship with the Father and with our siblings (72)
- The laws given after the golden calf have a penitential purpose, meant to teach spiritual truths and restore Israel to spiritual health (77)

## Chapter 5: The Covenant with David
- Genesis through Joshua is all about Moses; Ruth through the end of the Old Testament is all about David (88)
- David is great: 
	- *Politically*: he founds a great nation, the Israelite Empire; and he establishes Jerusalem
	- *Liturgically*: he was a great reformer who practiced what he preached and showed his people the important place of worship in their lives; he also introduced singing and music into worship 
- David wants to build God a "house" (temple), but God promises to build David a "house" (dynasty) (93)
- The Davidic covenant: God promises David a son who will build God's temple, be the Son of God, and rule over Israel forever (94)

## Chapter 6: The New Covenant in the Prophets
- The high point of the entire Old Testament comes in [[1 Kgs-08|1 Kings 8]] when Solomon dedicates the temple, which was the symbol and sum of all the covenants and all salvation history (105)
- Nothing is greater than the Temple except for God, and Jesus reveals himself by saying "Something greater than the Temple is here" (107 cf [[Mt-12#v6]])
- The prophets are like weathermen: only storms and gloom in the short-term outlook, but sunny days in the extended forecast (108)
- Isaiah is the "fifth Gospel" because of its many prophecies of the Messiah (109)
- Every Mass is a fulfillment of [[Jer-31#v31]] ("I will make a new covenant", cf. [[Lk-22#v20]] "This cup is the New Covenant in my blood") (114)
- Ezekiel adds "everlasting covenant" to the covenant of peace ([[Ez-37#v26]], 119), the New Covenant spoken of by the prophets includes the restoration and transformation of the Davidic Covenant (121)

## Chapter 7: The Eucharistic Covenant 
- Jesus fulfills all the expectations associated with each of the great covenants in the Old Testament (127)
	- Adam: Jesus fulfills the fivefold role as son of God, king, priest, prophet, and bridegroom (127), these characteristics also connect him to Noah (133)
	- Abraham: Jesus is the promised "seed of Abraham" ([[Gn-22#v18]], 134)
	- Moses: Jesus is a prophet like Moses, but greater than him; Moses was replaced by Joshua, and Jesus is the new *Y'shua* (137)
	- David: the genealogies show Jesus' legal and biological lineage: he is both son and heir to David. Jesus gives us a temple better than Solomon's, his body (139)
	- Prophets: in the Passover meal Jesus establishes the new covenant in his blood (141); his body is the temple and it is flowing with the blood and water of the Passover (145)
- With the coming of the Holy Spirit the *divine filiation* that Adam enjoyed is not given back to all men (151)

## Last Word
- The main goal of this book is to show the Bible's unity (155, cf. [[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 112 about "content and unity")
- The message of the Bible is this: the sonship Adam once enjoyed with God has been restored to us by Jesus Christ (156)
- Our response to the scriptures should be this (156):
	- Receive the sacraments (which make us participate in the events of scripture)
	- Live our faith as priest, prophet, and king 
	- Keep learning more of God's Word
	- Share what we know
