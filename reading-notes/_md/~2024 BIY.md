### RSV-2CE vs ESV 

#### RSV-2CE Wins 
- [[Gn-02#v5]] etc: "till" the ground is better than "work" the ground 

#### ESV Wins 
- asdf

### General Notes 
- [[2024-06-06-Thu]]-[[Gn-04#v16]]: "east of Eden", like *[[~East of Eden|East of Eden]]*
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-14#v14]]: didn’t realize Abram was a great commander
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-14#v3]], 5: "Your servant" is like the mass line "your servant/my soul"
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-18#v27]]: Abraham addressing God while interceding for Sodom and Gomorrah illustrates the humility we should have before God when we pray: "I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes."
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Gn-19#v16]]: What feels rough to us may in fact be God's mercy, as when God saves Lot from the men of Sodom: "So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him."
- ==another "your servant" in [[Gn-19#v19]] (Lot speaking to God)==
- ==[[2024-06-08-Sat]] on prayer: ==
	- Jonah and God changing his mind after they repent 
	- In the furnace and God can save us if he wants 
- [[2024-06-08-Sat]]-[[Jb-01#v5]]: Job rose early and offered sacrifices for his children in case they have sinned, how should we do this for our kids? 
- [[2024-06-09-Sun]]-[[Jb-19#v25]]-27: "I know that my redeemer lives....!"
- [[2024-06-11-Tue]]-[[Jb-38#v3]]: God answering Job: "Dress for action like a man."
- [[2024-06-12-Wed]]-[[Ex-06#v7]] is the first of many "I will take you for my people, and I will be your God"
- [[2024-06-13-Thu]]-[[Lv-07#v20]] "the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the LORD's peace offerings while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people" foreshadows [[1 Cor-11#v27]] profaning the Eucharist 
- [[2024-06-14-Fri]]-[[Lv-11#v44]] is the first "be holy, for I am holy"
- [[2024-06-14-Fri]]-[[Ex-20#v25]] says "And if you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you wield your tool upon it you profane it." ==Why does hewing a stone profane it, and how do we reconcile this with a theology of work?==
- [[2024-06-15-Sat]]-[[Lv-20#v4]]-5 forbidding offering your children to Moloch echoes when we think about [[Abortion]]
- [[2024-06-17-Mon]]-[[Dt-02#v6]] ==has the killing even of children at the hands of Israel? This is awful: how does God allow this?==
- [[2024-06-17-Mon]]-[[Dt-03#v22]]: “it is the Lord your God who fights for you”
- [[2024-06-18-Tue]]-[[Dt-08#v2]]-3: "And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not. And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but that man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD."
- [[2024-06-18-Tue]]-[[Dt-08#v5]]: "Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, the LORD your God disciplines you."



### Themes
- The sanctity of marriage comes through in all the passages where Abram and then Isaac try to pass off their wives as their sister and the people they do this to are appalled because of the great sin it would have brought upon them.
- Power of prayer 
	- [[2024-06-06-Thu]]-![[Mt-21#v22]]
	- [[2024-06-11-Tue]]-[[Jb-42#v8]]: "And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly."
	- [[2024-06-13-Thu]]-Moses intercedes during the plagues in [[Ex-08#v13]], [[Ex-08#v30]], [[Ex-10#v18]]
	- [[2024-06-17-Mon]]-God repents of punishing the people for the Golden Calf after Moses' prayer in [[Ex-32#v11]]-14
