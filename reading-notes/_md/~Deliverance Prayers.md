## Introduction
- Say when we are tempted: "In the Name of Jesus Christ, be gone!"
- Authority is one of the primary requisites in order to drive out a demon
	- We remain protected when we remain under the authority structure that God has established
	- If we don't have authority to command (*"In the Name of Jesus, I command..."*), we can modify the prayer to request (*"Jesus, I ask thee to..."*)
- Diabolical influence occurs in our bodies (not in our souls)
- To engage in spiritual combat our own spiritual life must be in order (never falling into mortal sin and diligent in prayer, especially meditation)
- Our Lady, under the title Our Lady of Sorrows, can protect us from any diabolic attack of any kind
