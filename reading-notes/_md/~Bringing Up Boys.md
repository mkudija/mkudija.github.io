## Chapter 1: The Wonderful World of Boys
_**Summary**: _
- "For parents of boys the greatest challenge may be just keeping them alive through childhood and adolescence." (1)
- "Their assignment during two brief decades will be to transform their boys from immature and flighty youngsters into honest, caring men who will be respectful of women, loyal and faithful in marriage, keepers of commitments, strong and decisive leaders, good workers, and secure in their masculinity. And of course, the ultimate goal for people of faith is to give each child an understanding of Scripture and a lifelong passion for Jesus Christ. This is, I believe, the most important responsibility for those of us who have been entrusted with the care and nurturance of children." (7)


## Chapter 2: Vive LA Diff√©rence
_**Summary**: Boys are different from girls._


## Chapter 3: So What *Is* the Difference?
_**Summary**: _
- Hormones: more testosterone (facilitator of risk) and less serotonin (brakes) 
- Remember that boys are men in training



## Chapter 4: Wounded Spirits
_**Summary**: _
- Boys in our day are experiencing a crisis of confidence 
- The disengagement of parents is the underlying problem plaguing children today 
- The standard of perfection has shifted upward out of the reach of most kids 
- You must protect the spirit of your child: take time to listen and care and direct 
- "One of your most important assignments as a parent is to preserve the mental and physical health of your kids. You wouldn't think of letting someone injure them physically if you could prevent it. Why, then, would you stand by and watch the spirit of your boy or girl being warped and twisted?" (48)
- An overall sense of victimization is terribly destructive. Do not make your child feel victimized beyond the immediate circumstance. 


## Chapter 5: The Essential Father 
_**Summary**: _
- "Chief among the threats to this generation of boys is the breakdown of the family." (53)
- "A father holds awesome power in the lives of his children, for good or for ill." (57)
- "Disconnection and differentiation": when a boy pulls away from his mother at 3-5 yrs old 
- The absence of early supervision and discipline is often catastrophic 


## Chapter 6: Fathers and Sons
_**Summary**: _
- =="If character training is a primary goal of parenting, then the best way to install it is through the demeanor and behavior of a father==...If you are selfish or mean or angry, you'll see those characteristics displayed in the next generation." (69)
- A "good family man" is the family provider, the leader of the clan, a protector, and the spiritual director of the home. 


## Chapter 7: Mothers and Sons
_**Summary**: _
- Reach out physically and touch your boys if you want to get their attention. 
- "I am unalterably opposed to the placement of babies in day-care facilities unless there is o reasonable alternative." (85)
- Boys desperately need to be supervised and civilized. 
- Parental involvement is the key to getting kids through the storms of adolescence 
- The woman serves as the gatekeeper between kids and their dad. She can build the father-son relationship, or she can damage it beyond repair.


## Chapter 8: Chasing the Caterpillar
_**Summary**: _
- Overcommitment and breathlessness: "Routine panic characterizes the vast majority of people in Western nations."
- Slow down and make time for the family 
- Boys are more likely to suffer from busy parents than girls because they are more likely to get off-course when they are not supervised carefully 
- ==Parenting "must be your highest priority for a period of time...Raising children who have been loaned to us for a brief moment outranks every other responsibility." (107-108)==
