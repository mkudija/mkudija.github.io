`(New York: Emmaus Road Publishing, 2023-10-24), 269`

I read this alongside [[~Breaking the Bread A Biblical Devotional for Catholics Year B|Bergsma's]] , and preferred that. The commentary here is so short that it does not offer much depth, but I do appreciate the focus on broader themes and the beautiful art included.
