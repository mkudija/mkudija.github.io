`(Wheaton: Crossway, 2020), 1448`

Ordered from Amazon for ~$45.49 but returned because no apocrypha. Overall nice leather cover and sewn binding, but lots of marks of low-quality construction:
- text block not centered vertically in cover (bottom was sticking out)
- pale white paper
- very uneven rounded corners
- loose extra glue on top and bottom 
- leather cover not folded over making for ugly paste down, but result of this is that leather is fraying around edges 

Paid $45.49, then saw it for $43, then saw it for $38.66
