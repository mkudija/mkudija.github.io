`(Rome: Vatican, 1965), xx`

- "No Christian community, however, is built up unless it has its basis and center in the celebration of the most Holy Eucharist" (6)
- "This pastoral charity flows out in a very special way from the Eucharistic sacrifice. This stands as the root and center of the whole life of a priest. What takes place on the altar of sacrifice, the priestly heart must make his own. This cannot be done unless priests through prayer continue to penetrate more deeply into the mystery of Christ." (14)
- "Fidelity to Christ cannot be separated from faithfulness to his Church." (14)
- "Among the virtues that priests must possess for their sacred ministry none is so important as a frame of mind and soul whereby they are always ready to know and do the will of him who sent them and not their own will." (15)
- **"Outstanding among all these spiritual aids are those acts by which the faithful are nourished in the Word of God at the double table of the Sacred Scripture and the Eucharist."** (18)
