`(Rome: Vatican, 2005), 199`

>Read the divine Scriptures frequently; indeed, the sacred book should never be out of your hands. *(72, cf Jerome)*


Reading this is timely in three ways: given the recent death of Pope Benedict and a desire to more deeply read his works, having read the [[2022-12-31-The Bible in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz)|The Bible in a Year with Fr. Mike Schmitz]] last year and continuing this year, and currently reading the [[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]. There is in fact a great overlap between *[[2022-12-03-Dei Verbum|Dei Verbum]]*, the first part of the *CCC*, and the first part of *Verbum Domini*. Hearing the same passages quoted and the same ideas said slightly differently helps to cement these important ideas about God's word in my mind. 

*Verbum Domini* is beautiful and rich and wide-ranging. A few key reminders are that Scripture is intimately bound up with the Church and the Liturgy, we need the Holy Spirit to properly interpret Scripture, and that Scripture needs to be lived (not just read). 

>"To receive the Word means to let oneself be shaped by him, and thus to be conformed by the power of the Holy Spirit to Christ" *(50)*

- The Church is built upon the word of God (3) 
- He frames his discussion with the Prologue to [[John|John's Gospel]] ([[Memorize Scripture]])

- "The novelty of biblical revelation consists in the fact that God becomes known through the dialogue which he desires to have with us." (6)
- "Scripture is to be proclaimed, heard, read, received and experienced as the word of God, in the stream of the apostolic Tradition from which it is inseparable" (7)
- The right response to hearing God's Word is turning away from sin: "Listening to the word of God leads us first and foremost to value the need to live in accordance with this law 'written on human hearts'" (9, cf. *[[2021-08-12-Summa Theologiae|Summa Theologiae]]*, Ia-IIae, q. 94, a.2) 
- "being Christian is not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea, but the encounter with an event, a person, which gives life a new horizon and a definitive direction" (11, cf. *[[~Deus Caritas Est|Deus Caritas Est]]*)
- [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s image: the cosmos is the "symphony of creation", and Jesus is the solo (13)
- [[St. John of the Cross|John of the Cross]]: "Since he has given us his Son, his only word (for he possesses no other), he spoke everything at once in this sole word – and he has no more to say" (14, cf. *[[~The Collected Works of Saint John of the Cross#*The Ascent of Mount Carmel*|The Ascent of Mount Carmel]]*)
- "There can be no authentic understanding of Christian revelation apart from the activity of the Paraclete" (15)
	- [[St. Jerome]]: "we cannot come to an understanding of Scripture without the assistance of the Holy Spirit who inspired it" (16)
- "As the word of God became flesh by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary, so sacred Scripture is born from the womb of the Church by the power of the same Spirit." (19, cf. [[~Ignatius Catholic Study Bible|ICSB]] 26)

>All God’s promises find their “yes” in Jesus Christ. (20)

- "Each of us is thus enabled by God to _hear and respond_ to his word. We were created in the word and we live in the word; we cannot understand ourselves unless we are open to this dialogue." (22)
- [[Psalms]]: "God gives us words to speak to him" (24)
- "The obedience of faith must be our response to God who reveals." (25)
- Read the Bible to avoid sin: "sin is a refusal to hear the word" (26)
- "Mary is the image of the Church in attentive hearing of the word of God, which took flesh in her." (27)
	- The [[Canticle of Mary (Magnificat)|Magnificat]] is a "portrait of her soul woven from threads of Holy Scripture...She speaks and thinks with the word of God; the word of God becomes her word, and her word issues from the word of God." (28) 


### **[The Interpretation Of Sacred Scripture In The Church](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini.html#The_Interpretation_Of_Sacred_Scripture__In_The_Church)**
- "The primary setting for scriptural interpretation is the life of the Church" (29)
	- "The Bible is the Church’s book, and its essential place in the Church’s life gives rise to its genuine interpretation." (29)
- [[St. Gregory the Great|Gregory the Great]]: "The divine words grow together with the one who reads them." (30)
- "The study of the sacred page should be the very soul of theology" (31, cf. *[[2022-12-03-Dei Verbum|Dei Verbum]]*)
- Recognize the gifts of the [[historical-critical method]]: the salvation history is rooted in facts of history (32)
- But also recognize *the unity of the whole of Scripture*, and read Scripture *in the living Tradition of the whole Church* (34)
- Sacred Scripture "presupposes the harmony of faith and reason" (36)
- Scripture needs to transcend the "letter of the text" and move to a lived experience (38)
- [[Hugh of Saint Victor]]: "All divine Scripture is one book, and this one book is Christ, speaks of Christ and finds its fulfillment in Christ." (39)
- [[Typology]] discerns God's works of the Old Covenant prefigurations of what he accomplished in the fullness of time in the person of his incarnate Son (41, cf. [[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]])
- Read the dark passages of the Bible with the knowledge that it is deeply rooted in history and that God reveals himself progressively in successive stages (42)
- [ ] #read [Interpretation of the Bible in the Church](https://catholic-resources.org/ChurchDocs/PBC_Interp-FullText.htm) [[bib]]
- Listen to the Saints! 
	- [[St. Benedict]]: "Scripture is a most perfect norm for human life." 
	- [[St. Teresa of Ávila|Teresa of Ávila]]: "all the evil in the world is derived from not knowing clearly the truths of sacred Scripture"


## **[PART TWO: VERBUM IN ECCLESIA](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini.html#VERBUM_IN_ECCLESIA)**

- "To receive the Word means to let oneself be shaped by him, and thus to be conformed by the power of the Holy Spirit to Christ" (50)


### **[The Liturgy, Privileged Setting For The Word Of God](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini.html#The_Liturgy,_Privileged_Setting__For_The_Word_Of_God)**
- "The liturgy is the privileged setting in which God speaks to us in the midst of our lives...every liturgical action is by its very nature steeped in sacred Scripture." (52)
- "A faith-filled understanding of sacred Scripture must always refer back to the liturgy." (52)
- "In salvation history there is no separation between what God _says_ and what he _does_." (53)
- "Word and Eucharist are so deeply bound together that we cannot understand one without the other: the word of God sacramentally takes flesh in the event of the Eucharist. The Eucharist opens us to an understanding of Scripture, just as Scripture for its part illumines and explains the mystery of the Eucharist. Unless we acknowledge the Lord’s real presence in the Eucharist, our understanding of Scripture remains imperfect." (55)
- The reformed lectionary presents the most important texts with frequency and emphasizes the unity of the Bible as a whole (57)
- "When expressing contrition it would be good if the penitent were to use a prayer based on the words of Scripture" (61, [[Act of Contrition]]) ^093d5a
	- →"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" (cf. [[Lk-18#v38]], [[Mk-10#v37]])
	- →How about this adaptation of [[Mt-08#v8]]?: "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and *your* servant will be healed."

- Jerome's [[Parenting]] advice: "His advice to the Roman matron Leta about raising her daughter was this: '**Be sure that she studies a passage of Scripture each day… Prayer should follow reading, and reading follow prayer**… so that in the place of jewellery and silk, she may love the divine books'. Jerome’s counsel to the priest Nepotian can also be applied to us: '**Read the divine Scriptures frequently; indeed, the sacred book should never be out of your hands.** Learn there what you must teach'." (72)
- We need small communities of families to promote formation in Scripture! (73)
- Catechesis "must be permeated by the mindset, the spirit and the outlook of the Bible and the Gospels through assiduous contact with the texts themselves; yet it also means remembering that catechesis will be all the richer and more effective for reading the texts with the mind and the heart of the Church" (74)
- [[Memory|Memorize]]: "A knowledge of biblical personages, events and well-known sayings should thus be encouraged; this can also be promoted by the judicious _memorization_ of some passages which are particularly expressive of the Christian mysteries." (74)
- "Our call to holiness is revealed in sacred Scripture: “Be holy, for I am holy." (77, cf. [[Lv-11#v44]], [[Lv-19#v2]], [[Lv-27#v20#7]])
- Raising priests: "the word of God is indispensable in forming the heart of a good shepherd and minister of the word" (77)
- "The word of God is at the very origin of marriage" (85)
- "The Synod urged that every household have its Bible, to be kept in a worthy place and used for reading and prayer." (85)
- "Prayer should accompany the reading of sacred Scripture" (86)
	- [[St. Augustine|Augustine]]: "Your prayer is the word you speak to God. When you read the Bible, God speaks to you; when you pray, you speak to God"
	- [[Origen]]: understanding Scripture demands, even more than study, closeness to Christ and prayer
- [[Lectio divina]]: 
	- Read the text: *what does the Biblical text say in itself?*
	- Meditation: *what does this Biblical text say to us?*
	- Prayer: *what do we say to the Lord in response to his word?*
	- Contemplation: *what conversion of mind, heart, and life is the Lord asking of us?*
	- Action: *make our life a gift for others*
- Marian prayer is an aid to meditating on the mysteries of Scripture: [[The Rosary]] and [[The Angelus]]
	- "It is fitting that the announcement of each mystery be accompanied by a brief biblical text pertinent to that mystery, so as to encourage the [[Memory|memorization]] of brief biblical passages relevant to the mysteries of Christ’s life." (88) 
		- → [[The Mysteries of the Rosary]]

- "The novelty of the Christian message does not consist in an idea but in a fact: God has revealed himself." (92)

## **[Conclusion](https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini.html#CONCLUSION)**
- "I wish once more to encourage all the People of God, pastors, consecrated persons and the laity, to become increasingly familiar with the sacred Scriptures. We must never forget that all authentic and living Christian spirituality is based on the word of God proclaimed, accepted, celebrated and meditated upon in the Church." 121
