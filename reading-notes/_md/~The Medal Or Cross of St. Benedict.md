## Introduction 

- “Benedict is the Father of Europe” (XII)
- The West was peopled with monasteries, and from these monasteries flowed upon Europe all those blessings which have made it the privileged quarter of the globe. (xiii)
- Subiaco: “The devil having one day excited him to a violent temptation of impurity, he rolled himself amidst prickly brambles and extinguished within himself the desire of carnal pleasure by the pain he thus endured.” (xv)
