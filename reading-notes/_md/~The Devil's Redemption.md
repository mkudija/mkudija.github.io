## [[Ralph Martin]]'s review: [Review: The Devil’s Redemption - Homiletic & Pastoral Review](https://www.hprweb.com/2019/11/review-the-devils-redemption/)
- "I was so impressed with the book that I wrote a long review/essay of it." (cf. *[[2023-01-21-A Church In Crisis|A Church in Crisis]], 456*)
- Universalism first appeared in the Gnostic heresies within 100 years of the birth of the Christian church
- **Universalism**: the theory that holds that every human being will eventually be saved and that no human being (or in some variations, almost no human beings) will be in hell. Some universalistic theories also hold that even the devil and the demons will be eventually reconciled with God and be in heaven, hence the title of his book.
- "One of Dr. McClymond’s most original contributions to the study of universalism in the Christian churches is his discovery that universalism often arises from, and is significantly impacted by, recurring impulses of the fallen human mind to come up with theories that take away our discomfort with the concept of eternal punishment, despite the explicit teaching of Jesus and the apostles to the contrary, and as officially taught by all the Christian traditions up until fairly recently."
- "Based on a tabulation of data provided by Fr. Daley, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, McClymond concludes from his study of the first eight centuries that 68 of the authors clearly teach a two-fold outcome to human lives, heaven and hell; 7 authors are unclear; 2 teach something like eschatological pantheism; and 4 authors appear to be universalists in an Origenian sense. This is an important fact, as often the impression is given that a wider number of Fathers embraced universalism or that in some way the Orthodox Church does."
- "He identifies Karl Rahner, whose “anonymous Christian” theories became popular in the 1970s, and Hans Urs von Balthasar, whose “hope for the salvation of all” became popular in the 1980s, as the two theologians most responsible for this rupture with the tradition."
- [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]’s theories are currently the most influential
	- His theory is based on a misguided reading of scripture:
	- Contradictory statements in scripture about salvation must harmonized. The church does so as follows: "God desires that all men and women be saved and offers everyone the grace to be saved, but if this grace is rejected and there is a refusal to repent and believe persevered in to the end, they will be lost. The technical theological language for this is understanding that God’s antecedent will is indeed the salvation of all, but his consequent will is that all those who respond to his antecedent will by faith in Jesus and repentance will be saved, but those who don’t will be condemned. Balthasar’s facile rejection of the Catholic approach to Scripture and how the whole tradition has understood these complementary, not contradictory, verses is shocking."
	- This leads Bathasar to also place no emphasis on evangelization 

#### General Observations of Dr. McClymond

1.  One of the underlying motivations of universalism is a desire to accommodate to the culture, and the _zeitgeist_, the spirit of the age.
2.  One of the underlying motivations for universalism is an arrogance that thinks that our understandings of justice, mercy, and love are superior to Scripture and Tradition. It is a theory that is attractive to our fallen nature. We can end up judging God. A remarkable example of it comes in the words of John Stuart Mill, a 19th-century British philosopher: “I will call no being good, who is not what I mean when I apply that epithet to my fellow creatures” (84). This attitude permeates much of the rationale that universalists give for their turn to universalism.
3.  One of the underlying motivations for universalism is a “metaphysical revolt” against how things actually are, a revolt against nature and God.
4.  Much universalist “exegesis” of Scripture is an attempt to explain away its plain meaning.
5.  It’s remarkable that the “spirits” that are often invoked in universalist narratives seem to be in complete agreement that no one ends up in hell.
6.  To virtually impose grace on all whether they want it or not is to undermine the reality of grace and to diminish the dignity and seriousness of human life, and to do away with the possibility of real love and friendship between God and man.
7.  The adoption of universalism often results in the destruction of other revealed truths as well, such as the atonement, the nature of God, the nature of man, the identity of Christ, the significance of keeping the moral law, blurring the line between God and creation, between good and evil, etc.

#### Our Situation as Catholics Today: My Observations

1.  What a blessing to be a Catholic and have the wisdom and stability of Scripture, Tradition, and the _Catechism of the Catholic Church_.
2.  Yet, the bark of Peter is being tossed in a storm and an uncertain sound is coming from the trumpet, from many theologians, some of the bishops, and even the pope. Dr. McClymond quotes the troubling comment of Pope Francis as one of his chapter headings: “No one can be condemned forever, because that is not the logic of the Gospel!”
3.  We need to remember what Vatican II teaches about the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture.
4.  We need to remember that the _Catechism of the Catholic Church_ clearly teaches, in harmony with Scripture and Tradition, that there are two and only two ultimate outcomes, purgatory being a temporary state of purification and expiation.
5.  We need to remember that the Catholic Church has defined as certain doctrine, based on the Scriptures, that there are no “second chances” after death, that the state we die in is the state that determines our eternal destiny.
6.  Balthasar claims that the mystics support his “hopeful universalism.” They don’t. Catherine, Teresa, Our Lady of Fatima, St. Faustina, etc.
7.  When in doubt, go with Jesus, go with Mary. We’re fools not to.
8.  There are so many warnings in Scripture that amount to “don’t be deceived” (1 Cor 6:9–11; Gal 5:19–21; Eph 5:5–6; 2 Thes 2:9–12; Mt 7:13–23; Mt 24:22–28; etc.) and to not believe the “doctrine of demons” infiltrated into the Church by “plausible liars” (1 Tim 4:1–7; 2 Pet 3:3; Jud 18; _CCC_ 672).
9.  Let’s hold fast to the truth revealed to us for our salvation as it comes to us in Scripture, Tradition, the Magisterium, and is summed up for us in the _Catechism of the Catholic Church_. Let’s be ready to give a reason for the hope that we have within us, Christ in us, the hope of glory, and pray and sacrifice for the salvation of souls. Where there’s life, there’s hope. So let’s hope, and pray and witness for everyone alive today that they may believe and repent and be saved.
