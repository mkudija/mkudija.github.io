### [[~St Anthony Doctor of the Church|St. Anthony]]

- [[Memorize Scripture]]: "[[~St Anthony Doctor of the Church|St. Anthony]] knew both Testaments by heart. He knew the Bible in two ways: first, by study, whereby he had committed the Scriptures to memory and sought out their meaning; and second, by the light of the Holy Spirit, which he had merited by his prayerful and penitential life."
