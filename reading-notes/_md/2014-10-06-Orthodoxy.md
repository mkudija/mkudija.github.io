    * Magic must have a meaning, and meaning must have someone to mean it
    * This purpose is beautiful
    * The proper response is humility and restraint 
* Chapter 5
    * Something is great because we love it not the other way around
    * Optimism is analogous to patriotism
    * To be an optimist we must love what we chastise
    * The more love is bound the less it is blind
    * The moment we have a fixed heart we have a free hand 
    * Chesterton puts forward the ideal of the irrational optimist 
* Chapter 6 - the paradoxes of Christianity 
    * The world is nearly reasonable 
    * We must seek life with an indifference for our lives
    * Christianity seeks to keep opposite colors together and pure 
* Chapter 8
    * It takes more thought to use short words than long words 
    * "Catholic doctrine and discipline may be walls but they are the walls of a playground"
    * The church is a living being, as if you could meet Plato or Shakespeare at breakfast tomorrow 
    * I accept the church and not particular truths we pick out of it 
    * We can find adventures in a land of authority 
    * Man is more manly when joy is the primary thing in him
    * He ends by proclaiming Jesus' mirth and how he hid it 


From [[Dan Gibson]] 2021-12-17:
>Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, "Do it again"; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, "Do it again" to the sun; and every evening, "Do it again" to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; **for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we**.
