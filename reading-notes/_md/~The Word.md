## Foreword 


## Introduction 


## Chapter 1: A Brief History of Biblical Translation
_**Summary**: Gives a history of ancient translation work (Greek, Aramaic, and Latin); details about early modern translations by Luther, Tyndale, KJV, etc.; surveys modern English translations; and expresses hope for continued translations by committee as well as bold new individual translations._
- "It is clear that translating the Bible was by no means a novelty by the sixteenth century and the time of the Reformation." (17)
- "Even subsequent Catholic Bibles in German tended to adhere quite closely to Luther, demonstrating...the difficulty of deviating from the classic translation of a text. This is the problem that has beset all translations into English since the King James Version." (18)
- The KJV was not a new translation: "many of the striking phrases for which it is justly famous go back to the Bishops' Bible, to the Geneva or Great Bible, and even to Tyndale." (21)
- "The absence of the [[Deuterocanonical Books|Apocrypha]] from most editions of the KJV that are readily available in the UK results ultimately from the decision of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1826 to stop printing it, on religious grounds. Until then it had been normal for Bibles to include it, and readings from it were prescribed in the Church of England until the late twentieth century, when the custom arose of providing alternatives from the canonical Old Testament when the Apocrypha occurred in the Church lectionary. So far as I know, this momentous change took place silently and without debate." (22/291 footnote 17)
- "It is to be hoped that individual translators will go on tackling either the whole Bible or parts of it [being bold], even as committees continue to produce mainstream renderings." (29)
	- He praises Tyndale and Luther, Phillips and Moffatt, [[Robert Alter]]'s *[[~The Hebrew Bible A Translation with Commentary (Vol Three-Volume Set)|The Hebrew Bible]]* (add to this list [[Michael Pakaluk]]'s translations of the Gospels)
- Against *[[Sola scriptura]]*: "The Bible is not a single book speaking with one accent or style...It is a conglomeration of many individual texts from which no unified system of thought or doctrine can be derived. The content of the Bible both informs and reflects both Judaism and Christianity, but it is not an exact account of either: the two religions overlap considerably with the Bible, but neither is coterminous with it." (30)
