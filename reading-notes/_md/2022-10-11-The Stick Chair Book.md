`(Covington: Lost Art Press, 2021), 632`


I've wanted to build a chair for awhile, and the opportunity to earn a [Stick Chair Merit Badge](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2022/06/25/earn-your-stick-chair-merit-badge/) was the nudge I needed to get started. I used the [PDF Excerpt](https://blog.lostartpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Stick-Chair_excerpt.pdf) and a bunch of [[Lost Art Press]] blog posts to build my [[Build Log-Irish Stick Chair|first chair]]. Then I got *The Stick Chair Book* and read most of it while sitting in my new chair. 

*The Stick Chair Book* is now one of my favorite books: it is a beautiful book in both content and physical construction. I learned a lot and I can't wait to keep referring back to it as I build more chairs. Chris Schwartz tells you how it is and has fun doing so. So get some straight-grain wood and take the tools you have and go build a stick chair!

## Preface: Commonplace Chairs
- "Stick chairs are a close compromise between nature and the needs of regular people." (1)

## Introduction
- Don't always follow the conventional wisdom: use any straight-grain wood, it's ok to glue up seats and arms, moisture content isn't a big deal (12)
- "Vernacular" chairs: "use what you've got and use it to the fullest" (14)
- Grain is grain, just make sure it's straight (14)
- Chairs are more forgiving to build than cabinets (18)


# Part I: Thinking About Chairs

## For Those About to Rock, We Dispute You 
- "Unless you're an astronaut, I think chairs should be wood." (26)

## Wood for Stick Chairs 
- If you have the money, get a moisture meter (38)
- Basically just get straight grain boards and cut out the straightest components from them 

## Tool Kit for Stick Chairs
- "Tools can be an immense psychological burden. Every edge tool comes with an obligation to sharpen it, oil it, and store it properly. Plus, I quickly realized that making tools dull is more fun than making tools sharp." (51)
- Essential tools:
	- Jack plane - vintage Stanley No. 5, blade sharpened at 10" radius
	- Block plane - adjustable mouth, Lie-Nielsen No 60-1/2
	- Corded drill -  1/2" chuck, variable-speed trigger, side handle 
	- Spade bits - no screw, surface-ground
	- Bit extender
	- Spokeshaves 
	- Band saw - with magnetic task light and good blades (Wood Slicer 1/2")
	- Card scraper 
	- Pencil gauge - homemade 
	- Mallet
	- Dozuki saw - Gyokucho Razorsaw Dozuki
	- Rasp - half-round, 9"-12" long, #9—#12 grain
	- Sanding block - woven Mirka brand 
	- Sliding bevel - butt-locking, Stanley No. 18
	- Divider - Starrett No. 92-6 
	- Measuring - tape measure, 6" rule, combination square, yard stick 
	- Level 
	- Protractor 
	- Travisher 
	- Scorp/Inshave 
	- Also: Moisture meter, Veritas dowel maker, acid flux brushes, Lee Valley Tools universal sharpener 

## Stick Chairs & Windsors: A Tiny History 

## The Sticktionary 
- Stick chair: sticks driven into a solid seat 

## The Black (no Red!) Book of Chairmaking 
- W. Patrick Edwards: "To die with a [woodworking] secret is a sin" (117)



# Part II: Chairmaking Techniques

## Make & Shape the Seat
- ~16"x20"
- Join with loose tenons and peg from the underside 
- Underbevel 

## Leg-to-Seat Joinery 
- **Rake** (front to back) and **Splay** (side to side)
- ref *[[~The Chairmaker's Workshop|The Chairmaker's Workshop]]* by Drew Langsner [[bib]] for **sightlines** and **resultant angles** (150) 
	- I made a [[Chair Angle Calculator]]
- Most vernacular chairs have cylindrical mortises and cylindrical tenons rather than tapered ones (158)
- Tapered mortises and tenons have the advantage of being more forgiving to cut, you can correct the angle while reaming (161)

## Make & Tenon the Legs 
- Shape (and taper if you like) your legs with a Jack plane (just wax the sole and have a curved iron) 
- Drill a 5/8" hole as your target for shaping the tenons (190)
- Cut tenons before tapering the legs (194)
- Cut ~1 1/2" kerf for wedges (200)
- Don't worry: "I have yet to see an antique [chair] with perfect legs." (203)

## Make the Stretchers 
- Most stick chairs don't need stretchers, it's more a matter of preference (205)
- Direct drill the stretcher mortises (215)

## Arms & Hands 
- Avoid short grain as much as possible in the arm 

## Check, Check, Check (★)

## Drill the Arm & Seat for Sticks 
- "Use the Force"
- Make an arm jig (261)
- Backrest: 8º for formal dining, 14º for typical dining/desk, 20–25º for lounging (264)
- Stick spaced every 2-7/8" to 3"

## Make & Shape the Sticks 
- Buy dowels, or buy a Veritas Dowel Maker
- He uses a fine saw to kerf the sticks rather than a bandsaw (302)

## Saddle the Seat 
- Most vernacular chairs have little to no saddle 
- Shallow saddle, about 1/2" deep 
- Lay out the saddle with pencil, or route a shallow rabbet (306)
- Rough it out with an angle grinder, adze, or scorp (311)
- Smooth it with a travisher 
- Finish it with a scraper and sandpaper 

## Wedges 
- Mostly oak or ash 
- "If there's one thing I learned in graduate school, it's that big words often hide sloppy thinking. Let your work speak for itself." (333)

## Gluing Tools 
- modified acid flux brushes and old toothbrushes are your friends 

## Assemble the Undercarriage 
- glue it up and whack it all together

## Assemble the Uppercarriage 
- "Handmade chairs should put up a bit of a fight when you knock them together." (353)
- Live with your errors: "Mistakes that look huge in the afternoon usually look smaller the next day." (364)

## Make the Comb or Backrest 
- The comb is one of the most important aspects of the design (367)

## Level the Legs 
- Use Flexi-Felt woven wool pads (396)

## Make Pretty 
- One small stamp for each "error" (403)

## Chair Finishes  (★)
- re [[Wood finishing]]
- Favorite finishes: linseed oil/beeswax, soap, paint
- Using cheap/"durable" finishes is like cheap closing: looks great for a little while then have to get rid of it (406)
- Good brands: Allbäck Linseed Oil Wax, Tried & True Original, Odie's Oil, Heritage BeesBlock, General Finishes Milk Paint
- "Far East Wales" antique finish (423)

## Chair Comfort & Design 
- Seat height is one of the most important considerations (most chairs are too high)
	- 17" for dining/working chair, 15–16" for lounging chair 
- Seat size: 14–16" by 20–24"
- Armbow height: 8–9"
- Backrest: 15–20º back, about 22" off the seat
- Legs: 
	- Front: 17º splay and 17º rake
	- Back: 7º splay and 15–20º rake 
- Use whole number ratios (i.e. 3, 2, 3)




# Part III: 5 Chair Plans

## Simple Irish-y Armchair
- A version of this is the first chair I built: [[Build Log-Irish Stick Chair]]

## Curved Back Armchair 
- "In the Ohio River Valley, American black walnut was once so common that people built frame houses with it (then painted them)." (471)

## Lowback Stick Chair 

## Reconsider Paint 
- use General Finishes Milk Paint: "[Lamp Black](https://designs.generalfinishes.com/products/milk-paint-lamp-black)"
- Paint can be a way to focus on the design of your chair 

## Six-Stick Comb-Back 

## Comb-Back with Bent Armbow 

## Chairs & Crapitalism 
- What can we do about crap factory chairs? Make our own! (561)
- "The best way to make the people around you appreciate (or even accept) stick chairs is to build some and put them in your home. Well, that's what I did. Every stick chair around our dinner table is unique. They aren't a matched set. They're made from different woods. Some are painted and some aren't. They all have different forms - tall comb-backs, medium-size comb-backs, a backstool with arms, and lowbacks. None of the chairs looks more important than another." (563)
- He built "[Hobbit chairs](https://blog.lostartpress.com/2021/03/15/hobbit-chair-against-my-better-judgment/)" for his kids (that they took to college) (564)



# Appendices

## Sharpen Chairmaking Tools
- Before you buy, first try to work with what you have on hand. 
- Avoid grinding chairmaking tools: focus instead on touching up edges after each use (605)
