- History:
	- Because of the lack of time the [[Council of Trent]] was unable to complete a reform of this Breviary and this work was left to the Holy See. Our Predecessor, Saint Pius V, in the year 1568 promulgated the new Roman Breviary which sought to bring uniformity in this matter into the Latin Church. 
	- In 1911 Saint Pius X brought out a new Breviary, reciting the whole of the 150 psalms every week was restored
	- John XXIII simplified rubrics in 1960, then entrusted further reform to [[Vatican II]]
- Principles for the new form of the Office: 
	1. Can be adopted to priests in different ministry and laity to pray also 
	2. Revised format to fit the hours of the day: Prime abolished, Lauds and Vespers the hinges, Readings said any time, midday prayer at various hours 
	3. Reduction, but wider variety of the texts; 
	4. 4 week psalter, "a few of the psalms and the harsher verses of the psalms have been omitted because of difficulties which might arise in celebration of the Office in a vernacular translation"
	5. Wider Scripture readings harmonized with the Mass, present salvation history over the course of the year 
	6. Wider reading from the fathers 
	7. "Anything which is not historically true as been suppressed from this text"
	8. Intercessions and supplications added to Lauds and Vespers; [[Our Father]] added to both to "return to the ancient Christian custom of reciting this Prayer three times during the day"
- "Christian prayer is primarily the prayer of the entire community of mankind joined to Christ himself. Each individual has his part in this prayer which is common to the one Body, and it thus becomes the voice of the beloved Spouse of Christ, putting into words the wishes and desires of the whole Christian people and making intercession for the necessities common to all mankind. It obtains its unity from the heart of Christ himself." (cf. *[[~Sacrosanctum concilium|SC]]* 83)
- "When the Divine Office is said, our voices re-echo in Christ and his in us." 
- "In order that this shall come about it is necessary that that *warm and living love for Scripture* which emanates from the Liturgy of the Hours shall be renewed among all, so that in truth Sacred Scripture becomes the principal source of all Christian prayer. " (cf. *[[~Sacrosanctum concilium|SC]]* 24)
- [[Mental prayer]] is nourished by the readings and psalms and other parts of the Liturgy of the Hours
- "Let there resound throughout the Church a magnificent hymn of praise to God, and let it be united to that hymn of praise sung in the courts of heaven the angels and saints"
- In obedience, we should really only be praying the new Office: "From the date on which a vernacular version must be used, those who recite the Divine Office in the Latin language may use only this renewed form of the Liturgy of the Hours. But in the case of those who, because of age or other special reason, would experience great difficulty in following this new Order, with the consent of their own Ordinary they may use the former edition of the Roman Breviary in whole or in part, but only when saying the Office alone."
