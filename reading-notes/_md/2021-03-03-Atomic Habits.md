I subscribed to James Clear's newsletter for a few years and enjoyed listening to his book on habits. The story in the introduction had me crying thinking about my boys. Overall he lays out a solid framework for understanding human behavior change with lots of practical tips for starting or stopping habits to improve our lives.


# Key Takeaways
- **Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.** (38)
- **Four Laws of Behavior Change**
    1. Make it obvious
    2. Make it attractive
    3. Make it easy
    4. Make it satisfying 


# The Fundamentals
*Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference*

## Ch 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- Get 1% better every day (compound interest is powerful)
- Habits can work for or against you
- Be patient: progress may not be visible continuously but come in jumps
- An "Atomic Habit" is a small habit that is part of a larger system
- Focus on *habits* rather than *goals*
    - Winners and losers have the same goals (survivorship bias)
    - Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
    - Goals don't bring happiness
    - Goal prevent long-term progress
- "You don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

## Ch 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vise Versa)
- Three levels of change: *outcomes*, *processes*, and *identity*
- Focus on *who* you want to become rather than *what* you want to achieve
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. **Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.** (38)
- Continuously edit your beliefs and upgrade/expand your identity
- Habits matter not for results, but because they change your beliefs about yourself

## Ch 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
- Habit: behavior repeated enough that it is automatic
- Habits solve the problems of life with as little effort as possible
- The feedback loop of habits:
    - Cue
    - Craving
    - Response
    - Reward
- **Four Laws of Behavior Change**
    1. Make it obvious
    2. Make it attractive
    3. Make it easy
    4. Make it satisfying 


# The 1st Law
*Make It Obvious*

## Ch 4: The Man Who Didn't Look Right
- With enough practice your brain makes predictions without thinking
- We stop baying attention when our habits are automatic
- Behavior change always starts with awareness --> "Habit scorecard"

## Ch 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- The two most common cues are *time* and *location*
- Create an implementation intention by saying: *I will **BEHAVIOR** at **TIME** in **LOCATION**.*
- Habit Stacking is a strategy to pair a new habit with a current habit: *After **CURRENT HABIT**, I will **NEW HABIT**.*

## Ch 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior
- Every habit is initiated by a cue: make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment
- It is easier to build new habits in new environment because you are not fighting against old cues

## Ch 7: The Secret to Self-Control
- The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is *make it invisible*
- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten
- People with high self-control spend less time in tempting situations; it's easier to avoid temptation than resist it
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one

# The 2nd Law
*Make it Attractive*

## Ch 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible 
- The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is *make it attractive*
- Habits are a dopamine feedback loop
- It is the anticipation of reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive: pair an action you *want* to do with an action you *need* to do

## Ch 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us
- We tend to adopt habits that are praised by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige)
- Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is normal, and (2) you already have something in common with the group
- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual 

## Ch 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
- The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is *make it unattractive*
- The cause of your habits is the *prediction* that precedes them
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive
- Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit

# The 3rd Law
*Make it Easy*

## Ch 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
- The Third Law of Behavior Change is *make it easy*
- The most effective form of learning is *practice*, not *planning*
- Focus on taking *action*, not being in *motion*
- Habit formation is the process of making a behavior automatic through repetition
- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as total repetitions

## Ch 12: The Law of Lease Effort
- The Law of Least Effort: we gravitate toward the easiest option
- Create an environment where the desired behavior is as easy as possible
- Reduce friction for good behaviors and increase friction for bad behaviors
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier

## Ch 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward
- Many habits occur at decisive moments that send you on either the right or wrong path
- Two-Minute Rule: when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do
- Ritualize the beginning of a process to slip into a state of deep focus
- Standardize before you optimize: you can't improve a habit that doesn't exist

## Ch 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
- The inversion of the Third Law of Behavior Change is *make it difficult*
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future
- One time choices can automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time
- Use technology to automate your habits


# The 4th Law
*Make It Satisfying*

## Ch 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
- The Fourth Law of Behavior Change is *make it satisfying*
- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards
- Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: *What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.*
- Get a habit to stick by feeling immediately successful

## Ch 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
- Progress is one of the most satisfying feelings; use a habit tracker like marking an "x"
- Don't break the chain; keep the habit streak alive
- Never miss twice: if you miss one day, get back on track as soon as possible
- Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's the most important thing

## Ch 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
- The inversion of the Fourth Law of Behavior Change is *make it unsatisfying*
- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying
- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction
- A habit contract can be used to add a social to cost to any behavior
- Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator

*Habits cheat sheet on page 212-213*

# Advanced Tactics
*How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great*

## Ch 18: The Truth About Talent
- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition
- Pick the right habit and progress is easy
- Genes cannot be easily changed, and habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities
- Play a game that favors your strengths (or create one)
- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work, they clarify it by telling us *what* to work hard on

## Ch 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
- The Goldilocks Rule: peak motivation comes when we work right on the edge of our current abilities
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way

## Ch 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits
- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
- Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time
- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it
