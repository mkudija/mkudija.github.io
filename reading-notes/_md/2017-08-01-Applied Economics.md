## Chapter 1
* Politics and economics are separate, but must be considered together
* We need to think about economics in terms of both goals and incentives (which may be different)
* We need to think beyond just "state 1" in making policies (thinking ahead)
* The truth emerges over time, even though politicians often take politically positive short term action even if it is economically damaging over the long term (Nixon price controls)
* We need to be pragmatic rather than idealistic in economic policy

## * Chapter 2
* Greater importance of human capital: it accrues to those who continually grow their skills
* Removing low wage jobs has a bigger impact than just the lost wages, but also lost experience for later jobs 
* Long discussion of slavery and other forms of forced labor m

## Chapter 3 - Medical Care
* Who pays for what greatly influences demand for medical care 
* How pharmaceutical companies must recoup billions in development costs on low marginal cost drugs 

## Chapter 4 - Housing
* Basically he argues against land use regulations, which lead to increased housing costs 
* "Politics offers attractive solutions, but economics offers only trade offs" 
* Insurance reduces overall contingency for risk because risk is aggregated
* Shame around having a child out of wedlock disappeared after the costs associated with raising the child shifted from the parents to the government 

## Chapter 5 - Safety 
* Nothing is 100% safe; the real question is cost/benefit of reducing probability of failure 
* "Everything is unsafe if you disregard questions of degree and alternatives"
* Reinsurance companies further spread risk
* Subsidizing car insurance can have unintended consequences of raising prices for all drivers and increasing rates of pedestrian injuries and deaths 
* Government retirement plans are like a Ponzi or pyramid scheme: first in, first out 

## Chapter 6 - Immigration

## Chapter 7 - Discrimination 
* Prejudice vs bias vs discrimination
* Economic competition often naturally diminishes discrimination
