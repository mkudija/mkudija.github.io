# Universe of Stone: A Biography of Chartres Cathedral by Philip Ball

* “Chartres contains the first known statue of Mary” (62)
* “Gothic churches display, in a way that Romanesque does not, an overarching vision: a sense of wholeness and coherence.” (63)
* “I turned my face towards Paris and the thrill of this happy pilgrimage compelled me to confess: ‘Truly the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.’ It came to my mind how the poet said: ‘A happy thing is exile in such a place as this.’” - Peter Abelard (93)
