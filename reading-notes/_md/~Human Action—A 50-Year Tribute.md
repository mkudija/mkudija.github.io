about *[[~Human Action]]*

## Introduction
- [[Socialism]]: abolition of private property, the market economy, and money prices for consumer good and the factors of production (making rational economic calculation impossible)
- "Action" in *[[~Human Action]]* is **reason applied to purpose**
	- Laws of economics are logical (not empirical) relationships, and most choices are made on the margin
- Mises stressed the [[Law of Comparative Advantage]] as the reason for human association
- Business cycles are not natural but caused by government mismanagement of the monetary and banking systems
- "For half a century, *[[~Human Action]]* has served as the medium through which tens of thousands have learned the lessons of a society of peace, freedom, and prosperity. It stands, like Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*, as one of the great works not only of economics but of human and social understanding." (11)
