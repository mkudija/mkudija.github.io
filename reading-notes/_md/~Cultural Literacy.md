## Preface
*read 2022-01-11*
- "To be culturally literate is to possess the basic information needed to thrive in the modern world." (xiii)
- Cultural literacy is the path out of poverty but our schools are failing our children because of a "fragmented curriculum based on faulty educational theories" (xiii) 
- "Cultural literacy is represented not by a *prescriptive* list of books but rather by a *descriptive* list of the information actually possessed by literate Americans." (xiv)
	- This list of dates, names, topics is given in the appendix (152-214)
- History of education:
	- [[Rousseau]]: encourage "natural development" of young children and not impose adult ideas upon them before they can truly understand them
	- [[John Dewey]] in early 20th Century America heavily influenced by [[Rousseau]] in his *Schools of To-morrow*. He "mistook a half-truth for the whole." (xv)
	- [[Plato]]'s view, in *[[~The Republic|The Republic]]*, says the specific content we transmit to children is the most important, and a matter of ethics
	- Hirsch's corrective theory, or "**anthropological theory of education**": stresses the importance of specific information in early and late schooling since all human communities are founded upon specific shared information (xv)
- "Literacy...depends on literate culture" (xvii)
