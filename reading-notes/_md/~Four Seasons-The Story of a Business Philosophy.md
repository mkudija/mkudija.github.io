`(New York: Penguin, 2009-04-30), 326`

Hotelier Isadore Sharp once wrote,  "Employees are natural watchers. Everything their leaders say and do tells employees their real concerns, their real goals, priorities, and values” That is to say, leaders in customer-obsessed organizations embrace that employees look to them to set the bar.  Hopper expects leaders to model the service culture in all daily activities, so that their team members understand that pronouncements about service culture are more than just words on a page.
