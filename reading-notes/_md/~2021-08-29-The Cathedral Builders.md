# Notes


## Chapter 1: The Medieval Miracle
**Summary**: 

- An accurate historical representation of the cathedral builders was lacking until recently with historians such as Viollet-le-Duc and Pierre du Colombier (2)
- There is no real distinction between a Romanesque building and a Gothic building as is usually said, but rather hundreds of small technical innovations over a ~250 year period from the 11th–13th centuries (3-4); the building finally stopped around 1337 with the Hundred Years' War (28)


## Chapter 2: Saint Bernard and Suger
**Summary**: 

- "The spread of Christianity and the history of the builders are linked to the development of the monastic orders" (7) ....If the great cathedrals are the fruit of St. Benedict, what mighty things will be the fruit of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s new St. Benedict? (cf. [[2020-11-18-After Virtue#Ch 18 - After Virtue Nietzsche or Aristotle Trotsky and St Benedict]])
- The Cluniac reform and resulting demand for 1,400 monasteries advanced the science of construction (7)
- "The success of Cluny was due to the will of pious and energetic men who wanted to wrench Christian Europe from the barbarism of the tench and eleventh centuries. The success of Cîteaux was due to a group of men who in their desire for austerity wanted to wean the West form the vanity and worldly pleasures that were beginning to predominate." (8)

- Windows: "The history of building is tied to the unceasing attempt of architects to make openings in the walls without compromising the solidity of the buildings." (14)
- The 19th century safeguarded medieval buildings, the 17th and 18th centuries devastated them: "An inventory of the devastation of the eitheenth century would run to volumes." (22)
- The medieval cathedrals were originally brightly painted, despite the 20th century decision to restore them with bare stone (25)
