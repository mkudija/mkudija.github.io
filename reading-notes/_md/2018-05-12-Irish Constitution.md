Some interesting passages:

PREAMBLE
In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as
our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred,

We, the people of Éire, Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ, Who sustained our fathers through centuries of trial, 

Gratefully remembering their heroic and unremitting struggle to regain the rightful independence of our Nation,

And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence,
Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured,
true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established
with other nations,

Do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution

- The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental
unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and

- The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution
and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to
the welfare of the Nation and the State.
