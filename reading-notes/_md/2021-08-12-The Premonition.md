- “When a doctor stops seeing patients, they slowly start to forget. Seeing patients is how you develop a sixth sense.” (24) 
- “To do the job of a local public-health officer, you basically always need to be willing to lose your job.” (32)  
 - “Sins of commission got you fired. Sins of omission you could get away with, but they left people dead.” (42)  
- Charity Dean: "Mental masturbation is actually an important concept. It's when you talk in circles for an hour and reach no decision." (38)
- US pandemic plan began in 2005 when George W. Bush read *The Great Influenza* by John Barry (50)  
	- the leverage of [[Writing]] and sharing writing: (53-54)  
 	- Rajeev’s report got $7B in funding  
 	- Barry’s book: aid gave it to sec of HHS, who asked for 50 copies and had it marked up to highlight the important bits, and gave it to Bush  
- “When the systems depend on human vigilance, they will fail.” (67)  
- Carter Mecher: redesign the environment to prevent mistakes (eg 120 vs 240 V plugs) (69)  
 - *Human Error* by James Reason: “it was like reading the owners manual of the human mind”  
 - “the best way to guard against error is to design systems with layered and overlapping defenses”—> think of it as layered Swiss cheese (70)  
 - report near misses like aviation safety  
- Carter: I love how he dives into a problem, “reading books and interviewing authors” to find out how people learn and how good ideas spread, and then wrote a report (72)  
- Bob Glass model: no measures have significant impact, except closing schools (86-87)  
	- “I couldn’t design a system better for transmitting disease than our school system.” (91)  
- Carter reconstructed and furthered Barry’s analysis of the 1918 pandemic in Philadelphia to show that deaths were lower the earlier restrictions were imposed (101-102)

- fire extinguisher analogy: “the problem with implementing social interventions too late is you get all the downsides and little benefit, so speed it critical” (211)
