## Abstract 
- Interesting: species boundaries are maintained because hybrids are less fit:
    - Our lab has been investigating the outcomes of this hybridization and the forces that maintain species boundaries. One key focus of our research has been cognition, which we explore for its role in maintaining species boundaries. Specifically, previous work has suggested that hybrids exhibit reduced spatial memory and problem-solving abilities.
- My central hypothesis is that hybrid individuals have less diverse microbiomes than their parental species, and this results in lower cognitive abilities, therefore impacting their fitness.
- I developed and published a methodology for extracting microbial DNA from avian fecal and preen oil samples.
- I explored the relationship between cognitive performance and microbiome diversity


## Chapter 1: Introduction



## Chapter 2: Microbial DNA extraction method for avian feces and preen oil from diverse species



## Chapter 3: Environment strongly impacts gut microbiome community richness in hybridizing chickadees, while host ancestry influences community composition
- Among closely related species, host phylogenetic relationships are typically a stronger predictor of gut microbiome composition than environmental variation.
- Our analysis of alpha diversity showed that the transition to common environmental conditions significantly impacted host gut microbiome richness. In contrast, the change in host environment did not impact the community composition (i.e., beta diversity) of the gut microbiomes.
-  Although not statistically significant, host ancestry may influence the microbiome composition.
- **Question**: Figure 3.10 (pg 210) gives chloroplast group abundance in wild birds at different nesting sites. Does mix of chloroplasts from the birds match the mix of those plants in those nesting sites? Would differences between the respective mixes indicate food preference? 

## Chapter 4: Host microbiome diversity is weakly correlated with cognition across ancestry groups in hybridizing chickadees
- Gut microbiome alpha diversity main effects were not correlated with performance on the problem-solving or the associative learning tests (Table 4.1). Further, we saw no significant relationships between any alpha diversity interaction terms and performance on the associative learning test (Supplemental Table 4.8).
- None of the alpha diversity indices on their own significantly predicted performance on the problem solving test. However, the three-way interaction of Shannon diversity, ancestry, and sex approached significance (x2=6.9568, p=0.0733) (Supplemental Table 4.7, Supplemental Fig. 4.6).
- We did find a significant interaction between Faithâ€™s phylogenetic diversity and host ancestry impacting the problem-solving performance (x2=7.9106, p=0.0479) (Table 4.1, Fig. 4.1, Supplemental Fig. 4.6, Supplemental Table 4.7). 
- There were no significant correlations between cognitive performance and microbiome community composition based on any of the four beta matrices we used.
- The overall lack of significance across the other distance matrices indicates that aspects of community composition and overall abundance of bacteria groups do not seem to play a large role in the cognitive performance of these birds.
- Our results suggest microbiome diversity at least weakly influences cognitive function. 
- Figure 4.1 on pg 162: are the negative correlations hybirdized birds? (No)
    - negative slope 
        - black-capped chickadees (BCCH)
        - advanced generation Carolina backcross chickadees (ADV.CA)
    - positive slope 
        - Carolina chickadees (CACH)
        - recent generation hybrids (HYCH)


## Chapter 5: Conclusion
- I also contributed to broader discussions on the microbiome's relationship with ecological and species variation, and the potential for coevolution between hosts and their microbial communities
