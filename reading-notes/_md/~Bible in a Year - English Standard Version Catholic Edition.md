[[Deuterocanonical Books]]
>Until the sixteenth century, many, if not most, Christians accepted some of the Apocrypha as part of the Bible, or as an addition to the Bible, that was in either case spiritually worthy of reading. During the seventeenth century, the Apocrypha came to be called "deuterocanonical" (i.e., "second" or "secondary canon") books, and Protestants and Catholics made decisions about the role that these writings should (or should not) have in the Bible For example, [[Martin Luther]]'s first translation of the Bible (1534) included the deuterocanonical books (which he identified as "books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but useful and good to read") between the Old and New Testaments, though later Lutheran editions omitted them. In 1560, the Geneva Bible (which was translated by English Puritans exiled in Geneva, Switzerland) also printed the deuterocanonical books between the Old and New Testaments. Likewise, early editions of the King James Version (1611) did the same. Protestants, however, eventually decided not to include the deuterocanonical books (because they do not exist in their entirety in Hebrew or Aramaic, and due to doctrinal differences), and today few Protestant Bibles include them. As for Catholics, in 1546, the fourth session of the [[Council of Trent]] included the deuterocanonical books that were in the Vulgate as part of the Old Testament. Due to differing editions of the Vulgate (see above), it was necessary to determine which books to include. By 1590-92, the list was limited to the seven books and the additions to Daniel and Esther mentioned above. The Vatican I Council (1870) reaffirmed this list. Editions of the Catholic Bible intersperse the approved deuterocanonical works throughout the Old Testament rather than separating them, and the ESV Catholic Edition follows that practice.
