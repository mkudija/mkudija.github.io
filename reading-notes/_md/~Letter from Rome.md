THE "LETTER FROM ROME"  
CRITICAL EDITION: P. BRAIDO - TRANSLATION: P. LAWS,  
WITH MODIFICATIONS BY G. WILLIAMS.  
INTRODUCTION  
Don Bosco was in Rome on the business of the Salesian Society and other  
matters.  
The Letter was composed by Don Bosco's secretary, Fr John Baptist Lemoyne,  
who used an outline or sketch dictated to him by Don Bosco himself.  
After an initial and quite profound impression, the Letter was put aside:  
perhaps it was too close to the bone! It was revived by Fr Paul Albera, Don  
Bosco's second successor and past pupil, on the occasion of the inauguration of  
the great monument to Don Bosco erected by the Salesian Past Pupils in the  
square in front of the Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, in 1920.  
In recent times, it has become recognised as almost the "Magna Carta" of  
Salesian Education; as such it is now included as an appendix to the  
Constitutions of the Salesian Society, and those of other members of the  
Salesian Family.  
In reality, there are two letters: a shorter one addressed to the boys, and a  
longer one - subsuming the former - for the Salesians. Recent research has  
revealed that the letter was needed; all was not well at Valdocco, discipline  
having become a serious problem with the senior students.  
The dream context of the letter is a familiar theme in the life of Don Bosco.  
Rome, 10 May 1884  
My dear sons in Jesus Christ,  
Whether I am at home or away I am always thinking of you. I have only one wish,  
to see you happy both in this world and in the next. It was this idea, this wish of  
mine, that made me write this letter. Being away from you, and not being able  
to see or hear you, upsets me more than you can imagine. For that reason I  
would have liked to write these few lines to you a week ago, but constant work  
prevented me. And so, although I shall be back very soon, I want to send you

this letter in advance, since I cannot yet be with you in person. These words  
come from someone who loves you very dearly in Christ Jesus, someone who  
has the duty of speaking to you with the freedom of a father. You'll let me do  
that, won't you? And you will pay attention to what I am going to say to you,  
and put it into practice.  
"I have said that you are always and exclusively in my thoughts. Well, a  
couple of evenings ago I had gone to my room, and while I was preparing for  
bed I began to say the prayers my good mother taught me, and whether I simply  
fell asleep or became distracted I don't know, but it seemed that two of the  
former pupils of the Oratory in its early days were standing there before me.  
One of them came up to me, greeted me warmly, and said: "Do you recognise  
me, Don Bosco?"  
"Of course I do," I answered.  
"And do you still remember me?", the man went on.  
"I remember you and all the others. You're Valfre, and you were at the  
Oratory before 1870."  
"Tell me," went on Valfre, "would you like to see the youngsters who were at  
the Oratory in my time?"  
"Yes, let me see them," I answered. "I would like that very much."  
Valfre then showed me the boys just as they had been at that time, with the  
same age, build and looks. I seemed to be in the old Oratory at recreation time.  
It was a scene full of life, full of movement, full of fun. Some were running,  
some were jumping, some were skipping. In one place they were playing  
leap-frog, in another tig, and in another a ball-game was in progress. In one  
corner a group of youngsters were gathered round a priest, hanging on his every  
word as he told them a story. In another a cleric was laying with a number of  
lads at "chase the donkey" and "trades". There was singing and laughing on all  
sides, there were priests and clerics everywhere and the boys were yelling and  
shouting all round them. You could see that the greatest cordiality and  
confidence reigned between youngsters and superiors. I was overjoyed at the  
sight, and Valfre said to me: "You see, closeness leads to love and love brings  
confidence. It is this that opens hearts and the young people express everything  
without fear to the teachers, to the assistants and to the superiors. They  
become frank both in the confessional and out of it, and they will do everything  
they are asked by one whom they know loves them."  
At that moment the other past pupil, who had a white beard, came up to me

and said: "Don Bosco, would you like to see and know the boys who are at the  
Oratory at the present time?" This man was Joseph Buzzetti.  
"Yes," I replied, "it is a month since I last saw them." And he showed them to  
me.  
I saw the Oratory and all of you in recreation. But no more could I hear the  
joyful shouts and singing, no longer was there the lively activity of the previous  
scene. In the faces and actions of many boys there was evident a weary  
boredom, a surliness, a suspicion, that pained my heart. I saw many, it is true,  
who ran about and played in light-hearted joy. But I saw quite a number of  
others on their own, leaning against the pillars, a prey to depressing thoughts.  
Others were on the steps or in the corridors, or up on the terraces near the  
garden so as to be away from the common recreation. Others were strolling  
about in groups, talking to each other in low tones and casting furtive and  
suspicious glances in every direction. Sometimes they would laugh, but with  
looks and smirks that would make you not only suspect but feel quite certain  
that St Aloysius would have blushed to find himself in their company. Even  
among those who were playing, there were some so listless that it was clear  
they were not enjoying their games.  
"Do you see your boys?", asked my former pupil.  
"I can see them," I replied with a sigh.  
"How different they are from what we used to be," went on the past pupil.  
"Too true! What an apathetic recreation!"  
"This is what gives rise to the coldness of so many in approaching the  
sacraments, to neglect of the prayers in church and elsewhere; to their  
reluctance to be in a place where Divine Providence heaps every possible  
blessing on their bodies, their souls and their minds. This is why so many do not  
follow their vocation, why they are ungrateful to their superiors, why they are  
secretive and grumble, with all the other regrettable consequences."  
"I see, I understand," I said. "But how can we bring these youngsters to life  
again, so that we can get back to the liveliness, the happiness, the warmth of  
the old days?"  
"With charity!"  
"With love? But don't my boys get enough love? You know how I love them.  
You know how much I have suffered and put up with for them these forty years,  
and how much I endure and suffer even now. How many hardships, how many  
humiliations, how much opposition, how many persecutions to give them bread,

a home, teachers, and especially to provide for the salvation of their souls. I  
have done everything I possibly could for them; they are the object of all my  
affections."  
"I'm not referring to you."  
"Then to whom are you referring? To those who take my place? To the  
rectors, the prefects, the teachers, the assistants? Don't you see that they are  
martyrs to study and work, and how they burn out their young lives for those  
Divine Providence has entrusted to them?"  
"I can see all that and I am well aware of it, but it is not enough; the best  
thing is missing."  
"That the youngsters should not only be loved, but that they themselves  
should know that they are loved."  
"But have they not got eyes in their heads? Have they no intelligence? Don't  
they see how much is done for them, and all of it out of love?"  
"No, I repeat: it is not enough."  
"Well, what else is needed?"  
"By being loved in the things they like, through taking part in their youthful  
interests, they are led to see love in those things which they find less attractive,  
such as discipline, study and self-denial, and so learn to do these things too  
with love."  
"I'm afraid you'll have to explain that more clearly."  
"Look at the youngsters in recreation."  
I looked, and then asked: "Well what is special about it?"  
"You've been educating young people for so many years and you don't  
understand! Look harder! Where are our Salesians?"  
I looked, and I saw that very few priests and clerics mixed with the boys,  
and fewer still were joining in their games. The superiors were no longer the  
heart and soul of the recreation. Most of them were walking up and down,  
chatting among themselves without taking any notice of what the pupils were  
doing. Others looked on at the recreation but paid little heed to the boys.  
Others supervised from afar, not noticing whether anyone was doing something  
wrong. Some did take notice but only rarely, and then in a threatening manner.  
Here and there a Salesian did try to mix with a group of boys, but I saw that the  
latter were bent on keeping their distance from teachers and superiors.  
Then my friend continued: "In the old days at the Oratory, were you not

always among the boys, especially during recreation? Do you remember those  
wonderful years? They were a foretaste of heaven, a period of which we have  
fond memories, because then love was the rule and we had no secrets from  
you."  
"Yes, indeed! Everything was a joy for me then, and the boys used to rush to  
get near me and talk to me; they were anxious to hear my advice and put it into  
practice. But don't you see that now with these never-ending interviews,  
business matters, and my poor health I cannot do it any more."  
"Well and good; but if you cannot do it, why don't your Salesians follow the  
example you gave? Why don't you insist, why don't you demand, that they treat  
the boys as you used to do?"  
"I do. I talk till I'm blue in the face, but unfortunately not everyone  
nowadays feels like working as hard as we used to."  
"And so by neglecting the lesser part they waste the greater, meaning all the  
work they put in. Let them like what pleases the youngsters and the youngsters  
will come to like what pleases the superiors. In this way their work will be  
made easy. The reason for the present change in the Oratory is that many of  
the boys no longer have confidence in their superiors. There was a time when  
all hearts were wide open to their superiors, when the boys loved them and  
gave them prompt obedience. But now the superiors are thought of precisely as  
superiors and no longer as fathers, brothers and friends; they are feared and  
little loved. And so if you want everyone to be of one heart and soul again for  
the love of Jesus you must break down this fatal barrier of mistrust, and  
replace it with a happy spirit of confidence. Then obedience will guide the  
pupil as a mother guides her baby; and the old peace and happiness will reign  
once again in the Oratory."  
"How then are we to set about breaking down this barrier?"  
"By a friendly informal relationship with the boys, especially in recreation.  
You cannot have love without this familiarity, and where this is not evident  
there can be no confidence. If you want to be loved, you must make it clear  
that you love. Jesus Christ made himself little with the little ones and bore our  
weaknesses. He is our master in the matter of the friendly approach. The  
teacher who is seen only in the classroom is a teacher and nothing more; but if  
he joins in the pupils' recreation he becomes their brother. If someone is only  
seen preaching from the pulpit it will be said that he is doing no more and no  
less than his duty, whereas if he says a good word in recreation it is heard as

the word of one who loves. How many conversions have been brought about by  
a few words whispered in the ear of a youngster while he is playing. One who  
knows he is loved loves in return, and one who loves can obtain anything,  
especially from the young. This confidence creates an electric current between  
youngsters and their superiors. Hearts are opened, needs and weaknesses made  
known. This love enables superiors to put up with the weariness, the annoyance,  
the ingratitude, the troubles that youngsters cause. Jesus Christ did not crush  
the bruised reed nor quench the smouldering flax. He is your model. Then you  
will no longer see anyone working for his own glory; you will no longer see  
anyone punishing out of wounded self-love; you will not see anyone neglecting  
the work of supervision through jealousy of another's popularity; you won't hear  
people running others down so as to be looked up to by the boys: those who  
exclude all other superiors and earn for themselves nothing but contempt and  
hypocritical flattery; people who let their hearts be stolen by one individual  
and neglect all the other boys to cultivate that particular one. No one will  
neglect his strict duty of supervision for the sake of his own ease and comfort;  
no one will fail through human respect to reprimand those who need  
reprimanding. If we have this true love, we shall not seek anything other than  
the glory of God and the good of souls. When this love languishes, things no  
longer go well. Why do people want to replace love with cold rules? Why do the  
superiors move away from the observance of the rules Don Bosco has given  
them? Why the replacement little by little of loving and watchful prevention by  
a system which consists in framing laws? Such laws either have to be sustained  
through punishment and so create hatred and cause unhappiness or, if they are  
not enforced, cause the superiors to be despised and bring about serious  
disorders. This is sure to happen if there is no friendly relationship. So if you  
want the Oratory to return to the happiness of old, then bring back the old  
system: let the superior be all things to all, always ready to listen to any boy's  
complaints or doubts, always alert to keep a paternal eye on their conduct, all  
heart to seek the spiritual and temporal good of those Divine Providence has  
entrusted to him. Then hearts will no longer be closed and deadly subterfuge  
will no longer hold sway. The superiors should be unbending only in the case of  
immoral conduct. It is better to run the risk of expelling someone who is  
innocent than to keep someone who causes others to sin. Assistants should  
make it a strict duty in conscience to refer to the superiors whatever they know  
to be an offence against God."

Then I asked a question: "And what is the best way of achieving this friendly  
relationship, this kind of love and confidence?"  
"The exact observance of the rules of the house."  
"Nothing else?"  
"At a dinner the best dish is a hearty welcome."  
With that my past pupil finished speaking, and I went on looking at that  
recreation with great displeasure. Little by little I felt oppressed by a great  
weariness that became worse at every moment. Eventually it got so bad that I  
could resist no longer, and I shook myself and woke up. I found myself standing  
beside my bed. My legs were so swollen and hurt so much that I could not stand  
up any longer. It was very late and I went to bed, resolved to write these lines  
to my sons.  
I wish I did not have these dreams, they tire me so much. The following day  
I was dead tired, and I could hardly wait for the hour to come to go to bed that  
evening. But I was hardly in bed when the dream began again. Before me once  
again was the playground, with the boys at present at the Oratory and the same  
past pupil as before. I began to question him.  
"I'll let my Salesians know what you have told me, but what should I say to  
the boys of the Oratory?"  
"Tell them," he said, "to realise how much the superiors, the teachers, the  
assistants, plan and wear themselves out for love of them, since they would not  
sacrifice themselves so much if they didn't love them. Let them never forget  
that humility is the source of all peace of mind; let them be able to put up with  
each other's shortcomings, because there is no perfection in this world, only in  
heaven. Tell them not to grumble because it freezes the heart. But especially,  
tell them to live in the holy grace of God. If you are not at peace with God, you  
cannot be at peace with yourself, nor with others."  
"Are you telling me then that among my boys there are some who are not at  
peace with God?"  
"Among other reasons you already know, this is the principal cause of bad  
spirit. There is no need for me to tell you that you must do something about it.  
The one without trust is the one with secrets to guard, the one who is afraid  
the secrets will become known and bring him shame and trouble. At the same  
time, if his heart is not at peace with God he will be a prey to restless anxiety,  
intolerant of obedience, and get upset over nothing. Everything seems to go  
wrong for him, and because he has no love himself he thinks the superiors do

not love him."  
"But see here, my friend; look how many go to confession and communion  
here at the Oratory."  
"It is true that many go to confession, but what is radically lacking in the  
confessions of so many youngsters is a firm resolution. They tell their sins but  
they are always the same, always the same occasions, the same bad habits, the  
same acts of disobedience, the same neglect of duty. This goes on, month in,  
month out, even for years and some even continue in this way till they leave  
school. These confessions are worth little or nothing, and so they do not restore  
peace, and if a youngster in that state were to be called before God's  
judgement seat, it would be a serious matter indeed. But in comparison with  
the whole group in the house they are only a few. Look." And he pointed them  
out to me.  
I looked, and I saw those boys one by one. There were not many, but in them  
I saw things that brought profound bitterness to my soul. I do not want to put  
such things in writing, but when I come back I want to have a word with each  
one about what I saw. For the moment I limit myself to saying that it is time to  
pray and make firm resolutions, with facts and not just words, so as to show  
that the Comollos, the Dominic Savios, the Besuccos and the Saccardis are still  
among us.  
I put a final question to my friend: "Have you anything else to tell me?"  
"Preach to all, young and old alike, that they must remember they are  
children of Mary Help of Christians. Tell them she has gathered them here to  
take them way from the dangers of the world, so that they may love one  
another as brothers and give glory to God and to her by their good behaviour.  
Tell them that it is Our Lady who provides them with bread and the means to  
study, by endless graces and wonders. Remind them that they are at the vigil of  
the feast of their holy Mother, so that with her help that barrier of mistrust will  
fall which has been raised between boys and superiors by the devil, who knows  
how to use it to ruin certain souls."  
"And will we be successful in breaking down this barrier?"  
"Certainly you will, as long as young and old are ready to put up with some  
smll mortifications for love of Mary and do what I have told you."  
Meanwhile I continued to watch my youngsters, but at the sight of those I had seen heading  
for eternal damnation I experienced such heartache that I awoke. I still have to tell you

many important things that I saw, but I have neither time nor opportunity at present.  
And now I must finish. Do you know what this poor old man who has spent his whole life  
for his dear boys wants from you? Nothing else than, due allowances being made, we  
should go back to the happy days of the Oratory of old: the days of affection and Christian  
confidence between boys and superiors; the days when we accepted and put up with  
difficulties for the love of Jesus Christ; the days when hearts were open with a simple  
candour; days of love and real joy for everyone. I want the consolation and hope that you  
will promise to do everything I desire for the good of your souls.  
You do not realise how lucky you are in having come to the Oratory. I declare before  
God: it is enough for a young person to enter a Salesian house for Our Lady to take him  
under her special care. Let us all agree on this then: may the charity of those who  
command and the charity of those who must obey cause the spirit of St Francis de Sales to  
reign among us. My dear children, the time is coming when I will have to tear myself away  
from you and leave for eternity." (Secretary's note: at this point Don Bosco broke off the  
dictation; his eyes filled with tears, not of sorrow but because of the inexpressible  
tenderness that was evident from his face and voice; after a few moments he went on.)  
"And so I want to leave you, my dear priests and brothers and my dearest boys, on the road  
the Lord himself wants you to follow. For this purpose the Holy Father, whom I saw on  
Friday 9 May, sends you his blessing from the bottom of his heart.  
I will be with you on the feast of Mary Help of Christians, before the statue of our loving  
Mother. I want this feast to be celebrated with full solemnity, and that Fr Lazzero and Fr  
Marchisio see to it that you have a good time in the dining-room as well. The feast of Mary  
Help of Christians should be a prelude to the eternal feast that we will all celebrate one  
day together in heaven.  
With much love, your friend in Christ Jesus.
