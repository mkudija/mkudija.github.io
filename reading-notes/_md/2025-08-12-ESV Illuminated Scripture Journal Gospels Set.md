My 5-year old son is fascinated with sacred art and drawing, and the ESV Illuminated Scripture Journal is perfect for him! 

Recently he decided to illustrate a Bible. He would draw a scene on a piece of paper, and then add it to a notebook. He made some great illustrations but it quickly became unwieldy, so we got him the Gospel set of the ESV Illuminated Scripture Journal. 

The left page is the scriptural text in a great single-column layout. The right side is a blank page for notes or journaling, or in his case, illustration. There is a grid of very faint dots to help with alignment if you like, but they are not visible at reading length (see the last zoomed in picture to see what they look like). The set comes in a nice slipcase, so he can pull one out and illustrate while we read to him before it gets put back away without any extra paper floating around.
