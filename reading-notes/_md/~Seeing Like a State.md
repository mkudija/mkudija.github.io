## Introduction
*read early 2021, noted [[2022-11-12-Sat]]*
- Four elements of state-initiated social engineering (4-5): 
	- administrative ordering of nature and society 
	- high-modernist ideology 
	- authoritarian state using its full weight to bring high-modernist designs into being (also elites who repudiate the past and who have revolutionary designs for their people)
	- a prostrate civil-society that lacks the capacity to resist these plans
- Planned social order is *schematic*: ignores central features of reality (6)
- "Throughout the book I make the case for the indispensible role of practical knowledge, informal processes, and inprovisation in the face of unpredictability" (6, cf. [[self-competence]])
