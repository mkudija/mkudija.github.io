- “If he’s not the word of God, God never spoke”
- “...each the other’s world entire”
- “Just remember, the things you put in your head are there forever”
- “All of this like some ancient anointing. Evoke the forms. Where you have nothing else, construct ceremonies out of the air and breath upon them.”
- “My job is to take care of you. I was appointed to do that by God.”
- “We’re the good guys, and we’re carrying the fire.”
- “This is what the good guys do. They keep trying. They don’t give up.” (137)
- Old man: “Where men can’t live, gods fare no better”
- “What you put in your head is there forever.”
- the recovered sextant was “the first thing in a long time that stirred him”
