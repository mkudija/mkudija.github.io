# *Steal Like an Artist* by [[Austin Kleon]]

`(New York: Workman, 2012), 140`

# 1. Steal like and artist
**How to look at the world (like an artist)**
- find out what's worth stealing, then move on to the next thing

**Nothing is original**

**The genealogy of ideas**
- "you are a mashup of what you choose to let into your life" (11)

**Garbage in, garbage out**
- "you're only as good as the stuff you surround yourself with" (13)
**Climb your own family tree**
- pick a thinker/writer/artist you admire
- study everthing there is to know about them
- repeat as many times as you can
- then start your own branch of this "family tree"

**School yourself**
- "always be reading"
- "Nothing is more important than an unread library" (20)

**Save your thefts for later**
- carry a notebook with you


# 2. Don't wait until you know who you are to get started
**Make things, know thyself**
- you're ready; start making stuff

**Fake it 'til you make it**

**Start Copying**
- copy not like plagiarism, but like reverse engineering to learn
- copy to internalize their way of looking at the world

**Imitation is not flattery**
- emulation: imitate but go further and create something of your own


# 3. Write the book you want to read
**Write(/build/create) what you like**

# 4. Use your hands
**Step away from the screen**
- use analog for coming up with ideas, and computer for refining/perfecting the product
- make sure your routine includes non-digital time


# 5. Side projects and hobbies are important
**Practice productive procrastination**
- take time to be board (it's where new ideas come from)

**Don't throw away any of yourself**
- let the different pieces of yourself, different things you're interested in, coexist and mix


# 6. The Secret: do good work and share it with people
**In the beeginning, obscurity is good**
- use your obscurity (and lack of criticism) to experiment and take risks

**The not-so-secret formula**
- do work
- share it


# 7. Geography is no longer our master
**Build your own world**
- ride the bus, go to the library, and find other ways to get your own space

**Leave home**
- change is good for creativity


# 8. Be nice (the world is a small town)
**Make friends, ignore enemies**

**Stand next to the talent**
- "If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room" (104)

**"Quit picking fights and go make something"**
- use anger to fuel your work

**Write fan letters**

**Validation is for parking**
- don't rely on others for validation

**Keep a praise file**
- not often, but glance at it if you need a pick-me-up (affirmations)

# 9. Be boring (it's the only way to get work done)
**Take care of yourself**

**Stay out of debt**

**Get yourself a calendar**
- "check boxes" (or another appropriate action) to show tangible progress

**Keep a logbook**
- to record past events

**Marry well**
- good relationships keep you grounded


# 10. Creativity is subtraction
**Choose what to leave out**
- choose wisely and have fun
