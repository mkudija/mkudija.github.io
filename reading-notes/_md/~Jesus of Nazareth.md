#### Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread
- St. Cyprian: "we pray for *our* bread—and that means we also pray for bread for others" (151) and "Anyone who asks for bread for today is poor. This prayer presupposes the poverty of the disciples. It presupposes that there are people who have renounced the world, its riches, and its splendor for the sake of faith and who no longer ask for anything beyond what they need to live." (152)
- Interpretations of *[[epioúsion|epiousios]]* (154)
	- "What is needed for existence"
	- "Bread for the future" or eschatological bread, or himself
	- "St. Jerome's Vulgate translates the mysterious word *[[epioúsion|epiousios]]* as *supersubstantialis* (i.e., super-substantial), thereby pointing to the new, higher 'substance' that the Lord gives us in the Holy Sacrament as the true bread of our life." 
	- [[Jn-06|John 6]]: "The eternal Logos does not concretely become bread for man until he has 'taken flesh' and speaks to us in human words." (155-156)
	- "When we consider Jesus' message in its entirety, then it is impossible to expunge the eucharistic dimension from the fourth petition of the Our Father. True, the earthly nitty-gritty of the petition for daily bread for everyone is essential. But this petition also helps us to transcend the purely material and to request already now what is to come "tomorrow," the new bread. And when we pray for "tomorrow's" bread today, we are reminded to live already today from tomorrow, from the love of God, which calls us all to be responsible for one another." (156)
