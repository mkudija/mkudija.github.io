`(New York: Catholic Answers Press, 2017-09-15), 383`

- Why does the Roman Catholic Church not accept the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Orthodox Church?
	- Should a Catholic read these?


## Preface 
- Question for the book: **_Did the Council of Trend add books to Old Testament Scripture or did Protestantism remove them?_** (7)
- "The issue of the deuterocanon is perhaps *the* most important subject for anyone who takes the word of God seriously." (9)

## Introduction
- "The question of which books belong to the Bible is more fundamental than theology because theology is to be based upon divine revelation." (14)
## Chapter 1: Was the Old Testament Closed Before Christ?
- Anti-Deuterocanon argument: *The Old Testament canon was closed before Christ and before the deuterocanon was written, so it cannot be Scripture* (17)
- Three arguments are given to support this:
- 1) **No Prophets**: Scripture is prophetic, but 1 Maccabees denies prophets in that day, so Deuterocanon is not scripture 
- 2) **Jesus' Bible**: Jesus' Bible is identical to the Rabbinic Bible, which does not include the Deuterocanon
- 3) **Cessation of Prophecy**: Prophecy ceased after King Artaxerces (5th century BC), so Deuterocanon cannot be Scripture 
- 
## Chapter 2: The Deuterocanon and the New Testament
## Chapter 3: The Closing of the Rabbinic Bible
## Chapter 4: The Bible of the Earliest Christians
## Chapter 5: When Contents Became Canon
## Chapter 6: Crossing the "Apocrypha" Line
