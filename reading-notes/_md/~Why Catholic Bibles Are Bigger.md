`(New York: Catholic Answers Press, 2017-09-15), 383`

- Biggest question from this book: ==Why does the Roman Catholic Church not accept the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Orthodox Church?==
	- Should a Catholic read these?
	- 90


## Preface 
- Question for the book: **_Did the Council of Trend add books to Old Testament Scripture or did Protestantism remove them?_** (7)
- "The issue of the deuterocanon is perhaps *the* most important subject for anyone who takes the word of God seriously." (9)

## Introduction
- "The question of which books belong to the Bible is more fundamental than theology because theology is to be based upon divine revelation." (14)
## Chapter 1: Was the Old Testament Closed Before Christ?
- Anti-Deuterocanon argument: *The Old Testament canon was closed before Christ and before the deuterocanon was written, so it cannot be Scripture* (17)
- Three untenable  arguments are given to support this:
	- 1) **No Prophets**: Scripture is prophetic, but 1 Maccabees denies prophets in that day, so Deuterocanon is not scripture 
		- "Prophet" in two senses: *public* prophets, and *post facto* prophets 
		- Ezra and Nehemiah two examples of non-prophets who wrote protocanonical books
	- 2) **Jesus' Bible**: Jesus' Bible is identical to the Rabbinic Bible, which does not include the Deuterocanon
		- First-century Judaism was comprised of several groups (there was no single canon)
	- 3) **Cessation of Prophecy**: Prophecy ceased after King Artaxerces (5th century BC), so Deuterocanon cannot be Scripture 
- The NT indirectly shows that prophets and prophecy were a common feature of the time (47)
## Chapter 2: The Deuterocanon and the New Testament
- The NT quotes the deuterocanon (including 10 references in the 1611 KJV), it does not quote a number of protcanonical books, and it quotes non-canonical writings. The presence of a quote is not sufficient, but the *way* it is quoted (50)
- Important references:
	- [[Mt-27#v43]] and [[Wis-02#v15]]-16
	- [[Jn-10#v22]] and [[1 Mc-04#v59]] ("Feast of Lights")
	- Extensive allusion to [[Sirach]] in [[James]] (65)
	- ...many others listed and evaluated 
- "The inspired authors of the new Testament referenced, used, and integrated the deuterocanon into their work just as they did the other Old Testament texts...The New Testament authors used the deuterocanon in a way indistinguishable from Sacred Scripture." (69)
## Chapter 3: The Closing of the Rabbinic Bible
- Various Jewish canons (71)
	- Sadducees and Samaritans: only the five books of Moses 
	- Essenes: not Esther, but Tobit, Sirach, Enoch, and others 
	- Shammai and Hillel Pharisees disagreed about Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Esther 
- Only Christians and Pharisees survived the first revolt; Jamnia became the new center of Jewish religion (73)
- Jewish oral tradition was written under Akiva ben Joseph (75), using the *inclusion and exclusion* method giving the interpreter latitude to read vast amounts of legislation into the Hebrew text (76)
- Rabbi Akiva closed the canon of the rabbinic Bible, corresponding roughly to the Hebrew Masoretic Text. Akiva rejected the Gospels, Sirach, and all books written afterward, hence being a "hostile witness" to the fact that the earliest christians accepted both the Gospels and the deuterocanon as Sacred Scripture (79)
## Chapter 4: The Bible of the Earliest Christians
- He goes father-by-father and notes relevant citations they make...
- "The apostolic fathers freely use the deuterocanon much in the same way as they do the other books of Scripture, which mirrors what we found in the New Testament." (89)
- "As Ralph Brabban concludes after a thorough examination of the Apostolic Fathers, their 'canon' was not restricted to the contents of the rabbinic Bible, but it appears to be much larger, including the book of Wisdom, Sirach, Judith, Esther (expanded version), Tobit, 4 Esdras, (1) Enoch, and expanded Jeremiah, and perhaps others as well." (90, cf. *[[~The Use of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha in the Writings of the Apostolic Fathers|The Use of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha in the Writings of the Apostolic Fathers]]*)
	- →==main question: why reject the others?==
- Conclusion: "The earliest extra-biblical Christian writings show a marked acceptance of the deuterocanon...Origen appealed to the universal use of these books as Scripture in the Church." (113)
- With the exception of Julius Africanus and a pair of qualified quotations from Origen, the fathers universally accepted the deuterocanon (117)
## Chapter 5: When Contents Became Canon
- [[St. Athanasius|Athanasius]] was the first to construct a comprehensive list of Sacred Scripture (117)
- Cyril of Jerusalem: "And whatever books are not read in churches, these read not even by you, as you have heard me say." (125)
	- →*Should our reading be somewhat proportional to the appearance in the lectionary?*
- Goes through some later fathers to show how they use the deuterocanon...
- None of the fathers up until the fourth century assigned the deuterocanon to the category of apocrypha (144)
## Chapter 6: Crossing the "Apocrypha" Line
- [[St. Jerome|Jerome]] sowed the seeds of confusion about the deuterocanon for centuries to come (145)
- Pope Damascus commissioned Jerome to produce a fresh Latin translation of Sacred Scripture (the Vulgate)
- **Hebrew Verity**: Placing the Hebrew Masoretic Text over all other versions: Jerome had many versions of the Greek [[Septuagint]], but what he thought was a single, stable Hebrew Bible, so why not translate directly from Hebrew.
- In principle Jerome was right, but he made an error in thinking that the MT was the single Hebrew original. This error was demonstrated by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls which shows that parts of the Septuagint preserve remnants of a more ancient Hebrew original that is now lost. 
- Jerome was the first Western Father to deny the inspiration of the deuterocanon, which was an innovation (147)
- Jerome wrote prefaces to his translation circulating this innovative view, including "ragged patches of words" and "gold in the slime" (149)
- "Jerome's innovation tampered with the deposit of faith. The Church does not make Scripture. Instead, the bride of Christ passively receives the written word of God from Christ and his apostles as part of the original deposit of faith." (152)
- [[St. Augustine|Augustine]] recognized Church usage as the indicator of canonicity: "The canonical scriptures he will judge according to the following standard: to prefer those that are received by all the Catholic churches to those which some do to receive." (154 cf *[[~On Christian Teaching|On Christian Teaching]]*)
- The Church normally doesn't define a doctrine unless a truth of the Faith has been denied or undermined. It wasn't until Jerome rejected the deuterocanon and broadcasted his opinion that clarification was need at the councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage III (397)
- Pope Innocent I's canonical list mirrors the Councils of Rome, Hippo, Carthage and reaffirms the traditional canon (163)
- Jerome's innovative idea that the deuterocanon is apocryphal was met by a series of decrees that reaffirmed the historic Christian Old Testament (165)
## Chapter 7: The Age of Preservation
- Jerome's Vulgate became *the* version by the sixth century, lending credibility to his prefaces and views on the deuterocanon, causing some to adopt his views (167)
- The earliest complete Christian bibles are from the fourth and fifth centuries (chart on 168 showing which books are included). None are restricted to the shorter Hebrew canon; all include some, many, or all of the deuterocanon, which are intermixed with the other books (170)
- "Isidore is an excellent example of how a writer acknowledges the rabbinic canon whithout rejecting the deuterocanon." (179)
- Study Scripture like [[St. Bede]]: "From the time of my admission to the priesthood to my re present fifty-ninth year, I have endeavored for my own use and that of my brethren, to make brief notes upon the holy Scripture, either out of the works of the venerable Fathers or in conformity with their meaning and inter-pretation." (182, cf. *Ecclesistical History*, Book 5, 24)
- Alcuin was the first to try to reconcile Jerome's opinion with the rest of the Church (185)
- *Glossia Ordinaria of Sacram Scripturam* was a Bible with commentary from the Fathers arranged around the text (188)
## Chapter 8: "As Jerome Saith..."
- The Middle Ages saw a renewed study of Scripture which reinvigorated Jerome's writings. Everyone was aware of Jerome's opinions on the deuterocanon: most followed the Church, some tried to reconcile Jerome with the Church, and a few followed Jerome entirely (196, 213)
- [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] uses the deuterocanon authortatively throughout (207)
- This chapter surveys what various scholars thought; the four who followed Jerome entirely are [[Hugh of Saint Victor]], [[John of Salisbury]], [[Nicholas of Lyra]], and [[William of Occam]]
## Chapter 9: Florence, Trent, and the Renaissance..
- Jerome's influence increased in the Renaissance, especially the 13th and 14th centuries 
- The [[Council of Florence]] (1439-1445) issued a decree that included a list of the books of Sacred Scripture, the first time any ecumenical council had raised the issue to this level of solemnity (216)
- On the importance of continuing to work for the unity of [[Vatican II]]: "The most important and authoritative councils of the Church took decades (even centuries) to bring about unity; the great [[Nicaea I|Council of Nicaea]] of 325, for instance, accepted by both Catholic and Protestant alike, was contradicted by important figures *within the Church* for decades afterward." (218)
- The [[Council of Trent]] decided early on to address Scripture and Sacred Tradition because both were prerequisites to all discussions of doctrine (229)
	- Trent "received the books simply and entirely as the Church had done in other councils, especially Florence, without further distinctions" (231)
	- "Did Trent *add* books to the Bible? The answer is decidedly no." (234)\
- [[Vatican I]] rejects the idea that they are *made* canonical by being declared such by the Church. The Catholic Church teaches that the canonical books are canonical because they were written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and, in God's providential care, were entrusted to the Church." (236)
## Chapter 10: Why Protestant Bibles Are Smaller
- "Before 1599, nearly all Protestant bibles included the deuterocanonical books; between the years 1526 and 1631, Protestant bibles with the deuterocanon were the rule and not the exception. It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that the tide began to turn toward smaller bibles for Protestants. By 1831, the books of the deuterocanon, along with their cross-references, were almost entirely expunged from Protestant translations. This eradication has been so complete that few Protestants today are aware that such editions of Scripture ever existed. This process of eradicating the deuterocanon began with Martin Luther." (237)
- [[Martin Luther]]: 
	- Published his 95 theses in 1517, and cited the deuterocanon as Scripture in three publications in 1518 (237+)
	- At the Second Leipzig Disputation in 1519 on the subject of purgatory Eck appealed to [[2 Mc-12#v45]]. Luther refused to allow 2 Maccabees to be entered into argument because it does not belong to the canon. This led to his [[Canon Within a Canon]] approach where the canon is a spectrum of authority depending on each books *apostolicity* (243-245)
	- Luther's Bible (1534) ordered the OT chronologically and put the deuterocanon in an appendix called *Apocrypha* at the end of the OT (247)
		- "Apocrypha—that is, books which are not held equal to the holy scriptures and yet are profitable and good to read." (247, from Luther's title page)
- The Zurich Bible (1531) had an appendix of *Apocryphi*. [[Zwingli]] states in the preface that the Apocrypha are included "so that no one may complain of lacking anything, and each may find what is to his taste." (250...how like [[Jgs-21#v25]]!!)
- [[John Calvin]] in preface to the 1540 edition of the Geneva Bible: "the Apocrypha is not to be despised, insofar as it contains good and useful teaching...but these writings cannot provide full assurance of their faith" (251-252)
- 
## Chapter 11: The Deuterocanon in Exile.
 -

- 
## Appendix 1: Sola Scriptura and the Problem of the Canon..
