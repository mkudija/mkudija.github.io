<div class="note"> <p>Style is important in translation, and most modern translations have not given sufficient attention to the style of the original Hebrew. This is often a symptom of attempting to explain everything to the modern reader and achieve a level of precision that does not exist in the ambiguous original.</p> </div>

## Autobiographical Prelude 
- "Any translation of a great piece of writing is bound to be imperfect...The practice of translation entails an endless series of compromises." (ix)
- Another of his books: *The Art of Biblical Narrative* (x, [[bib]])
- "There was something wrong with all the existing translations" of Genesis (xi), esp. [[Gn-18]] and [[Gn-19]] (x)
- He then translated Genesis and provided a commentary, later to be come his *Five Books of Moses* [[bib]]
- "From the beginning my translation was impelled by a deep conviction that the literary style of the Bible in both the prose narratives and poetry is not some sort of aesthetic embellishment of the "message" of Scripture but the vital medium through which the biblical vision of God, human nature, history, politics, society, and moral value is conveyed." (xiii)
	- Example: [[Isaiah]] uses word play to convey his meaning by juxtaposing two words with similar sounds but opposite meanings to how virtue and vice had been mixed (xiii)
	- This also makes this a book on Biblical style (xiv)

## Chapter 1: The Eclipse of Bible Translation
_**Summary**: _
- [[William Tyndale]], a "translator of genius", influenced the Geneva Bible and the King James Version, even including Ecclesiastes that he didn't live to translate but which bears elements of his style (1-2)
- "This preference for the King James Version [55% on survey in 2014] is surely dictated in part by the woeful inadequacies of the twentieth-century English translations." (2) ..."misconception that for modern readers everything in the biblical text needs to be explained." (3)
- Strengths of the King James Version:
	- "inspired literalism", for example the italicized addition of words not in Hebrew, maintaining parataxis, preserving the small vocabulary of the Bible (3)
	- He criticizes three translations other than KJV of [[Gn-07#v17|Gn-07#v17-18]] ([[check verses]])—including the New Jerusalem Bible—for subordinating clauses rather than maintaining parataxis—"the grand rhythm of parallel utterances is turned into something commonplace" (6)—and for replacing *was* and *went* with continued/lasted and floated/drifted—"Such substitutions seriously compromise the beautiful dignity of the Hebrew with its adherence to a purposefully simple lexicon of primary terms." (6)
- Problems with the King James version:
	- The English language has changed in 400 years 
	- The translators had an imperfect grasp of biblical Hebrew and made mistakes 
	- Stylistic issue: does not treat poetry as well as it does prose: "The power of biblical poetry inheres in its terrific compactness", rather than the "orotund and expansive Jacobean rhetoric" of KJV (9)—the translators *read* Hebrew but didn't *hear* it. [[Jb-03#v11]] ([[check verses]]): "the meaning of the Hebrew is there, but the poetry gets lost in the verbiage" (9)
- "The impulse to explain through translation has still more dire consequences because it becomes an explanation to make the Bible conform to modern views or modern ideologies." (7)
- Boom: "This is manifestly not how the biblical writers chose to tell their stories." (7)
- Don't throw the KJV baby out with the bathwater: original, overly precise translations are misguided because (10):
	- "The Bible itself does not generally exhibit the clarity to which its modern translators aspire: the Hebrew writers reveled in the proliferation of meanings, the cultivation of ambiguities, the playing of one sense of a term against another, and this richness is erased in the deceptive antiseptic clarity of modern versions."
	- Don't ignore the KJV: "It has been such a powerful presence for four centuries of English readers that a translation of the Bible that proceeds as though it simply didn't exist becomes hard to read as a version of the Bible that has any literary standing."  ^372153 ...modern translations should "create a modern transmutation of how the King James translators imagined the Bible should be rendered in English" 
- Literary style is not studied in mainstream biblical studies, just philology, but this neglect results in less than full understanding (12)
	- For example, [[Jgs-14#v19]] ([[check verses]]): "spoil" or "garments" is actually "armor" (13)
	- "The absence of a literary perspective in the training of biblical scholars thus leads to serious deficiencies in the translations they produce, but at least as problematic is the fact that most of them appear to be out of touch with the literary culture of our own times...not only do the modern translators lack a clear sense of what happens stylistically in the Bible, but also their notion of English style tends to be rather shaky" (15-16)
- [[Generalism]]: "My suspicion is that the problem stems from the specialization of knowledge that leads to a focusing on one area of rather technical expertise and a lack of intimate connection with other cultural spheres—precisely what was not true for the King James translators." (17)
- Modern translations hold the conviction that a word always has to have a context-specific translation into English, hold a "horror for repetition"; he disagrees with this and prefers to keep same for same in the original (21)
- Lawrence Venuti distinguishes between "domesticting" and "foreignizing" translations: Alter prefers the latter (22)
- He also does not agree with "dynamic equivalence" (23)
- Everett Fox emulated the German version by [translating](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Books-Moses-Leviticus-Deuteronomy/dp/0805211195) into English in a way that attempts to capture the rhythm of the Hebrew; he criticizes this approach because it makes it less idiomatic in the target language thereby creating distortion (24)
