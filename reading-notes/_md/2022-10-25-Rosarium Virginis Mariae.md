## Introduction
- The Rosary, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric prayer. (1)
- With the Rosary, the Christian people _sits at the school of Mary_ and is led to contemplate the beauty on the face of Christ and to experience the depths of his love. (1)
- [[Pope Paul VI]] emphasized the Rosary's the Rosary's evangelical character and its Christocentric inspiration in *[[~Marialis Cultus|Marialis Cultus]]* [[bib]]
- [[John Paul II]]: "The Rosary is my favorite prayer." (2)
- He declares 2002–2003 as "The Year of the Rosary": "To recite the Rosary is nothing other than to _contemplate with Mary the face of Christ_." (3)
- He frequently cites his prior encyclical *Novo Millennio Ineunte* [[bib]], first in (5)
	- "What is needed is a Christian life distinguished above all in the _art of prayer_." (5)

## Contemplating Christ with Mary 
- The Transfiguration (cf. [[Mt-17#v2]]: "And he was transfigured before them; his face shone like the sun") can been seen as an *icon of Christian contemplation*. (9)
- The contemplation of Christ has an _incomparable model_ in Mary. (10)
- The Rosary, precisely because it starts with Mary's own experience, is _an exquisitely contemplative prayer_. (12)
- The Rosary is part of this varied panorama of “ceaseless” prayer. (13)
- "Lady, thou art so great and so powerful, that whoever desires grace yet does not turn to thee, would have his desire fly without wings." (*[[2022-02-16-Paradiso|Paradiso]]* XXXIII, 13-15)

## Mysteries of Christ—Mysteries of His Mother 
- In (19), Pope John Paul II proposes the Luminous mysteries 
- The simple prayer of the Rosary marks the rhythm of human life (25)
- *Redemptor Hominis* [[bib]]: "it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the mystery of man is seen in its true light" (25)
- Each mystery of the Rosary, carefully meditated, sheds light on the mystery of man. (25)
- [[Ps-55#v23]]: “Cast your burdens on the Lord and he will sustain you” (25, cf. [[Favorite Bible Passages#^881316]])

## "For Me, to Live Is Christ" 
- The Rosary helps us to be conformed ever more closely to Christ until we attain true holiness. (26)
- The Rosary can be thought of as a Western analogy to the Eastern tradition of the [[Jesus Prayer]] (27)
- The Rosary is simply _a method of contemplation._ (28)
- Consider meditating upon an icon of each mystery as you pray it (29), and proclaiming a related passage from scripture (30)
- _Listening and meditation are nourished by [[silence]]._ (31)
- When the _Hail Mary_ is properly understood its Marian character is not opposed to its Christological character, but that it actually emphasizes and increases it. (33)
	- The center of gravity in the Hail Mary, the hinge which joins its two parts, is *the name of Jesus*. (33)
	- Notes custom in certain regions of highlighting the name of Christ by the addition of a clause referring to the mystery being contemplated (33, cf. *[[~Marialis Cultus|Marialis Cultus]]* [[bib]] 46)
- Conclude each mystery with _a prayer for the fruits specific to that particular mystery_. (34)
- The Rosary beads (36): converge upon the Crucifix since the life and prayer of believers is centered upon Christ; are a chain that links us to God; remind us of our many relationships 

## Conclusion
- Like the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], the Rosary is a prayer of and for the family, a prayer that brings the family together (41)
