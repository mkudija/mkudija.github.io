- Prices are like messengers conveying news. (14)
- The primary role of prices is to provide financial incentives to affect behavior in the use of reources and their resulting products. (15)
- The price which one producer is willing to pay for any given ingredient becomes the prices that other producers are forced to pay for that same ingredient." (20)
- Resources tend to flow to their most valued uses. (20)
