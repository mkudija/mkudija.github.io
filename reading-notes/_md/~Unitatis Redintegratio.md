`(Rome: Vatican, 1964), PPP`

- "Christ summons the Church to continual reformation as the sojourns here on earth. The Church is always in need of this, in so far as she is an institution of men here on earth." (6)
- "All the faithful should remember that the more effort they make to live holier lives according to the Gospel, the better will they further Christian unity and put it into practice." (7)
- [[Hierarchy of truths]]: "When comparing doctrines with one another, they should remember that in Catholic doctrine there exists a "hierarchy" of truths, since they vary in their relation to the fundamental Christian faith. Thus the way will be opened by which through fraternal rivalry all will be stirred to a deeper understanding and a clearer presentation of the unfathomable riches of Christ." (11)
