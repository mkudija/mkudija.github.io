## Introduction
- Along with [[Hebrews]], [[Romans]] is the closest thing we have to a formal theological treatise in the New Testament. Romans is all about the drama of sin and salvation. (xxiii)
	- But Romans has little or nothing to say about the Church, the Eucharist, the second coming, etc.
- "Paul's achievement in Romans is to showcase this truth as the distilled essence of Christianity. The gospel is nothing if not a message of unmerited grace, of God's love redeeming a world undeserving of such a blessing." (xxiv)
- The theology of Romans falls under the following 4 categories:
1. **The Righteousness of God**: God who keeps his covenants with Abraham and David 
2. **The Reconciliation of the World**: Justification and divine adoption 
	- *Justification* establishes the believer in a right covenant relationship with God, and *Divine adoption* is the premiere blessing bestowed on the Christian. (xxvii)
	- Justification and adoption represent two dimensions of the same reality: salvation by grace through faith in Christ. Both are actualized in the liturgical context of baptism. (xxvii)
3. **The Restoration of Israel**: he marvels at the way God uses even disobedience, first among Gentiles and then among Israel, to bestow his mercy on all. (xxviii)
4. **The Requirements of the Christian Life**: he provides some intermittent instructions for Christian living 
- "It is one of the most loved of the Pauline Letters, and yet it does not yield its secrets willingly...Paul is one of the most brilliant theologians the Church has ever known." (xxix)
