* From [[Pascal]]'s *[[2014-01-25-Penseés|Penseés]]*: "Not only do we only know God through Jesus Christ, but we only know ourselves through Jesus Christ; we only know life and death through Jesus Christ.  Apart from Jesus Christ we cannot know the meaning of our life, or our death, of God or of ourselves." (22)
* The core of the disagreement of the reformation was not justification by faith, religion and politics, the Bible, the corruption of the Church, the Pope, Mary/the saints, purgatory: it was about the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist (29)
* the Church as the "Theory of Everything", the unified field theory in religion (29)
* George Macdonld's The Golden Key is his favorite fairy tale (and Tolkien's also) (33)
    * the Golden Key is allegorical for Christ
* "Because of His omnipresence, nothing is secular…He unites everything except sin." (36)
* "God is such a gentlemen that He asked permission from His mother to be born! (48)
* "Find a parish that sings.  Better yet, make your parish a parish that sings." (53)
* The transcendentals: 
    * Beauty, Truth, Goodness
    * "These are the three things we all want infinitely an absolutely.  They are the three attributes of God our very nature tells us about." (53)
    * Christianity is succeeding in Truth and Goodness, but not beauty anymore
* From *[[2013-12-11-Meditations in a Toolshed|Meditation in a Toolshed]]* by [[C. S. Lewis]]: "Everything in this world is to be looked-along, and God looked-at, for everything is a means and God is the end." (122)
* "Man is a cathedral, and God is the builder." (132)
* "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit! 1 Corinthians 6:19
* "The Eucharist is a sword.  It is pointed at your heart.  This is not a clever ploy of mine, an image I invented; it is pure scriptural logic.  For the Eucharist is Christ, and Christ is the Word of God, and the Word of God is a sword." (143)
* LOTR reference 146
* quote 156: he loves us for our own sake
* This is the one book Peter Kreeft wishes people would read (cf. min 35 of [Matt Speaks to His 6th Favorite Person in the World, Dr. Peter Kreeft - Pints With Aquinas](https://pca.st/i5mayye5))
