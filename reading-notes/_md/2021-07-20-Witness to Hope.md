# [*Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II*](https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Hope-Biography-Pope-John/dp/006018793X) by [[George Weigel]]

`(New York: HarperCollins, 1999), 960`

I bought this off Amazon for $4 back in June of 2015 when I was living in LA. I forget why I bought it then but it was perhaps after listening to *John Paul II: A Personal Portrait of the Pope and the Man* by Ray Flynn. Its bulk sat on my shelf while I continued to read *Rise, Let Us Be On Our Way*, *[[2019-12-23-Centesimus Annus|Centesimus Annus]]*, *Theology of the Body*, and *The Jeweler's Shop* by him, and *[[2019-03-10-Lead Yourself First|Lead Yourself First]]* by Raymond Kethledge, *John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father* by Peggy Noonan and *Saint John Paul the Great* by Jason Evert about him. Then at the end of May 2021—with high recommendation from [[Fr. Dailey]]—I felt prompted to pick it up and dive in. What an adventure!

The years 2018–2020 were for reading William Manchester's *[[2018-07-11-Last Lion—Visions of Glory|The Last Lion]]* trilogy on Churchill[^churchill], and now the years 2021–2023 can be for reading Weigel's John Paul II trilogy.

[^churchill]: Churchill, by the way, is perhaps the one other figure who may have claim to be the greatest figure of the 20th century apart from John Paul II, a thought I had while finishing *[[2021-08-02-Team of Rivals#^2b09ad]]*.

I love reading biographies because it is simultaneously the story of a person and the history of the world they inhabited. This here is not only the story of John Paul II, but also a history of Poland's "double defeat" in World War II by the Nazi's and subsequent Communist rule, the most lucid history of Vatican II and its implementation I have yet encountered, and a fascinating view into the workings of the Holy See. 


Themes:
- Christian humanism and anthropology as a response to the dangers of modernity
- Speaking truth to power, the power of hope, and how there is no fear if we are rooted in Christ: "Be not afraid!" (66)
- Always propose, never impose: "You must decide" (13, 105)
- Priority of culture: history is driven by culture (7, 22, 296)
- The crisis of the modern world is a crisis of *ideas*, and a crisis of the *idea of a human person* (7)
- The drama of life: we are moral agents, and Christ is the center of the cosmic drama (8)
- The Law of the Gift (136)
- 


from Prologue (6-7)
- Against modernity's pleasure seeking, he teaches that suffering is central and redemptive (34: redemptive suffering central to Polish self-understanding)
- Against intellectual skepticism, he teaches that universal truths exist, are knowable, and impose moral duties (70)
- Against plastic personality, he defends a universal human nature
- Against a world that equates happiness with success, he teaches that happiness comes from obedient submission to truth and love
- Against utility, he focuses on inherent human dignity

## Chapter 1: A Son of Freedom
*Early life*
- The **Battle of the Vistula** (Miracle on the Vistula): August 1920 battle that saved Poland from the Soviets (17)
- Poland was known for its religious toleration (19)
- Mieszko was baptized Latin-rite Catholic in 966 (rather than Eastern) and anchored Poland in the West for 1000 years (20)
- The Polish nation survived the destruction of the Polish state --> John Paul's theme of culture (not politics or economics) being the driving force in history (22)
- Karol Wojtyła's father was the most influential figure to him: autodidact, a man of constant prayer, his example was a "domestic seminary" ([[2019-03-10-Lead Yourself First#^fbec9c]]) (29+)
- [[Daily Routine]] as a boy: rose early, pray, 7 am mass, 8 am school, evening walk (31)
- Karol Wojtyła received a [[Classical Education]]: Latin, Greek, Polish (32)
- Dignity of [[Work]] in the works of Norwid: "Work accepted with love is the highest manifestation of human freedom and is thus redemptive" (35)

- "[[Fatherhood]] meant rejecting the prison of selfishness; fatherhood meant being conquered by love." (42)


## Chapter 2: From the Underground
*The Third Reich*
- [[Spiritual Disciplines]]: confession on the first Friday of the month according to Catholic custom and Karol Wojtyła's personal habit (45)
- WWII formed John Paul II (46)
	- "The wars horrors and an unexpected encounter during the Occupation with a lay mystic began to shape Karol Wojtyła's distinctively [[Carmelite]] spirituality, which focused on the cross as the center of the Christian life, and indeed the center of human history." (46)
	- This was his experience of manual labor and **cultural activism**: the defense of national cultural identity as a means of political resistance and liberation (46)
	- Poland was the only nation where the Nazis failed to establish a collaborationist regime (48)
- [[Reading]]: Karol Wojtyła: "While others were dying of boredom I have surrounded myself with books, dug in with Arts and Sciences" (55). He also took the night shift since it was easier to read then (56).
	- *True Devotion to Mary* by St. Louis de Montfort (57)
- [[Work]] is a participation in God's creativity (57), and "We work because we love—our families, our children..." (58)
- **Jan Tyranowski** (59+): self-taught, read broadly in Catholic spirituality, who acted as a lay leader to Karol Wojtyła and others after the Salesian fathers were rounded up by the Nazis
	- "It's not difficult to be a saint" --> led him to regularize his spiritual life in a systematic fashion
	- weekly hour-long meetings to learn the spiritual life
	- his lay ministry demonstrated to Karol Wojtyła the universal call to holiness
	- he introduced Karol Wojtyła to [[St. John of the Cross]]: *Poetry*, then *The Ascent of mount Carmel*, *The Dark Night of the Soul*, *The Spiritual Canticle*, *The Living Flame of Love*
		- Karol Wojtyła learned Spanish to read him in the original
- Rhapsodic Theater: proclaim truth against the violent lies of the Occupation, speak truth to power (cf. *[[2021-07-15-"Live Not by Lies"]]*) (66)
- [[Realism]]: Reading *Metaphysics* by Kazimierz Wais convinced him (along with [[Aristotle]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]) that the world is intelligible (against the radical skepticism of the age) (70)
- [[Fr. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, OP]] (master of traditional neo-scholasticism) directed Karol Wojtyła's dissertation on [[St. John of the Cross]]'s understanding of faith (85)
	- he also wrote *Predestination*, recommended by [[Fr. Raymund]] when I was struggling with Thomas' treatment of predestination while reading the *[[Summa Theologiae]]*



## Chapter 3: "Call Me *Wujek*"
*Early priesthood*
- The Polish Church "knew the transient nature of political regimes" (91)
- [[Daily Routine]]: Karol Wojtyła worked 16-18 hour days (95)
- Karol Wojtyła engaged students intellectually with **Christian Humanism** as a university chaplain to combat the militant atheist Marxism of the regime (95)
	- He organized a group to read the *[[Summa Theologiae]]* in Latin (!)
- The "hardest-fought battle between Church and regime involved family life...all organized by the state to separate parents from their children as frequently as possible" (97)
- Karol Wojtyła's line: **"You have to decide."** --> he gently forced judgment and choices (105)
- Karol Wojtyła believed the goal of [[Confession]] was the sanctification of all life. The confessor is a "counselor in the practice of the virtues" (107)
- Karol Wojtyła believed "[[Marriage]] is the beginning of our understanding of the interior life of God...the human experience that begins to make God comprehensible to human beings" (116)
- Literature is a "supple instrument for delving into the hidden depths of the human condition" --> *The Power and the Glory* by Graham Greene and *The Plague* by Camus (117) 
- Poverty: Karol Wojtyła never had a bank account or personal money (119)
- Karol Wojtyła was "almost always late for meetings and appointments, having gotten himself absorbed in his previous engagement or his voracious and incessant [[Reading]]" (119)
- Resisting communism: Karol Wojtyła "was creating de facto networks of resistance to communism by helping to raise up a generation of Poles who could resist the communist culture of the lie with the truth of their religious and moral convictions" (120)


## Chapter 4: Seeing Things as They Are
*Wojtyła the Philosopher*
- **Phenomenology**: bring everyday things back into philosophy, see things whole and as they are, see [[Max Scheler]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], [[Edith Stein]] (127)
	- cf. *[[2020-11-18-After Virtue|After Virtue]]* (128): "If the choice was not between good and evil, but only between personal preferences, then all choices were ultimately indifferent and the real choice no longer existed" --> removes human freedom (129)
	- synthesized the metaphsical realism of [[Aristotle]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] with the human experience of [[Max Scheler]] (128)
- Karol Wojtyła constantly re-read the Gospel of [[John]], leading to his focus on people rather than texts (129-130)
- Pursuit of **philosophical anthropology** at the KUL (Catholic University of Lublin) (132):
	- The root of our issues is a modern crisis in the understanding of the human person --> requires redirecting philosophy since the [[Enlightenment]]
	- Seek to merge *metaphysics* (reality, things as they are), *anthropology* (nature and destiny of human person), and *ethics* (What ought we do?)
- Four principles that guided the KUL philosophers (133):
	1. Be realistic about the world and the human capacity to know it. *"Human beings can only be free in the truth, and the measure of truth is reality."*
	2. Philosophy should being with a reflection on the human person and human experience.
	3. Commitment to reason.
	4. Ecumenism of time: the past is not disposable to modernity 
- **"Ideas have consequences, for good and for ill. The history of the twentieth century's various torments, proved that defective understandings of the human person, human community, and human destiny were responsible for mountains of corpses and oceans of blood."** (134)
- **The Law of the Gift** was central to Karol Wojtyła's **personalism**: responsible self-giving, not self-assertion, was the road to human fulfillment (136)
	- see *Love and Responsibility* (137)
		- our sexuality reveals our dependence on others (141)
		- [[Chastity]] is the integrity of love, the virtue that makes it possible to love the other as a person (142)
- Wojtyła quirks: he could weirdly multi-task, thinks (and writes) in circles rather than linearly (making him hard to read at times), and made a point of learning from his students (138)


## Chapter 5: A New Pentecost
*Vatican II*
- *Gaudiem et Spes*: Karol Wojtyła's primary contribution to Vatican II
	- Working on *GS* began his special friendship with [[Henri de Lubac]]
	- To Karol Wojtyła, *GS* 22 (Christian humanism) was the theological linchpin and *GS* 24 (Law of the Gift) was the philosophical and moral of the entire Council (169)
- I hypothesize that Vatican II also created Pope John Paul II out of Karol Wojtyła by giving him exposure to his fellow bishops (169)
- Wojtyła viewed Vatican II as a "personalist" council: intense focus on the human person (171)
- *Person and Act* is Wojtyła's public account of Vatican II's teaching on freedom and truth (172-3)



## Chapter 6: Successor to St. Stanisław
*Living the Council in Kraków*
- The communists naively pushed for Wojtyła's nomination as Archbishop of Kraków, and he proceeded to be a thorn in their side (184)
- Bishop Wojtyła's approach to solving problems: (187-8)
	- *What truth of faith sheds light on this problem?*
	- *Who can we get—or train—to help?*
- Bishop Wojtyła's [[Daily Routine]]: wake at 5-5:30, 1 hour of private prayer, Mass, breakfast, 9-11 two hours of writing in front of the Blessed Sacrament, 11-1 visitors, lunch at 2 (188, 201)
	- [[Spiritual Disciplines]]: he prayed the [[Stations of the Cross]] every Friday
	- "The mainspring of his daily energy was his constant prayer" (201)
- Bishop Wojtyła pursued 7 priorities (188+): **Religious Freedom** (building churches and making a public display of Catholicism), the **Seminary** (a priest's holiness is the secret of pastoral success), **Youth Ministry**, **Family Ministry**, **Dialogue with Intellectuals**, **Charity**
- Karol Wojtyła's patron saint was Charles Borromeo (200)
- Wojtyła implemented Vatican II with the Synod of Kraków
	- He formed 500 study groups to read the texts of Vatican II with Wojtyła's *Sources of Renewal* as a commentary (205)
- *Humanae Vitae* (206)
	- Wojtyła set up the Kraków commission, which published a memorandum on *HV*, which "offered a more compelling explanation of *why*" the same conclusions reached make sense, rather than the tone deaf final product of *HV*
- [[Confession]]: "When a man goes down on his knees in the confessional because he has sinned, at that very moment he adds to his own dignity as a man." (224)
- Wojtyła was disturbed by the "insouciance in post-Vietnam American public live about the world situation, and the threats to the human hunger for freedom that were still being mounted by an aggressive atheistic ideology" (226)
	- --> noting this on [[2021-08-16-Mon]] during the disaster in Afghanistan and the fall of Kabul: will America be tempted to this again in the ashes of its second Vietnam?

	- John Paul II's [[Spiritual Disciplines]] included hour of prayer in the morning and several [[The Rosary|rosaries]], the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] "to which he attached great importance", [[Stations of the Cross]] every Friday during the year and every day during Lent
	- John Paul II made "all his major decisions on his knees before the Blessed Sacrament" (276)
- John Paul II's response to **liberation theology**: 
	- re-reading of the Gospel through ideological lenses was impossible (285)
	- Marxism was incompatible with Christianity due to its materialist reduction of humanism (285)
- John Paul II's first encyclical *Redemptor Hominis*: Christian anthropology (288)
	- the Incarnation tells us something about God, and something about ourselves
	- Religious freedom is the first right and can be engaged publicly by every thoughtful person


## Chapter 9: "How Many Divisions Has the Pope?"
*Confronting an Empire of Lies*
- To John Paul II the Polish case was not unique, but a window into the universal crisis of modernity (311)
- John Paul II visited [[St. Maximilian Kolbe]]'s starvation bunker at Auschwitz, and met Franciszek Gajowniczek, the man Kolbe had sacrificed himself for (314)
- A result of John Paul II's Poland pilgrimage was that people decided: "Let's stop lying....moral renewal among 'us' had to be the basis for any serious challenge to 'them'" (321, cf [[2021-07-15-"Live Not by Lies"]])
	- mentions [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] on how communist lies and violence are closely linked in his 1970 Nobel lecture (325)

- Theme of John Paul II's papacy: challenging the pulverization of the fundamental uniqueness of each human person, which was the crisis of modernity (334)
- *Theology of the Body* as a response to the failure of *Humanae Vitae* (334+)
	- start with Adam in the garden to recapture the wonder of philosophy like Aristotle (336-7)
	- Our creation as embodied persons and as male and female is a *sacramental* reality and an icon of the life of God (337)
	- The Christian sexual ethic redeems sexuality from lust (339)
	- Sexual love is an act of worship (341)
	- The human person is an intelligent creature called to maturity through self-mastery (342)
	- Sexuality is a way for us to grasp the essence of the human and come to understand the divine (343)

	- [[Fatherhood]]: men are called to live their fatherhood as an icon of "the very fatherhood of God" (385)

*Months of Violence and Dissent*
- John Paul II shot by Mehmet Ali Agca (Dziwisz administered last rites to him) (412)

- John Paul II intervened in the Jesuits
	- The temptations of various spiritualities: [[Franciscan]] to sentimentality, [[Dominican]] to arid intellectualism, [[Benedictine]] replacement of stability with complacency, [[Jesuit]] to becoming elite that no longer respects Church's authority (425)
