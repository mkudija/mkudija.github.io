# [*Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II*](https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Hope-Biography-Pope-John/dp/006018793X) by [[George Weigel]]

`(New York: HarperCollins, 1999), 960`

I bought this off Amazon for $4 back in June of 2015 when I was living in LA. I forget why I bought it then but it was perhaps after listening to *John Paul II: A Personal Portrait of the Pope and the Man* by Ray Flynn. Its bulk sat on my shelf while I continued to read *Rise, Let Us Be On Our Way*, *[[2019-12-23-Centesimus Annus|Centesimus Annus]]*, *Theology of the Body*, and *The Jeweler's Shop* by him, and *[[2019-03-10-Lead Yourself First|Lead Yourself First]]* by Raymond Kethledge, *John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father* by Peggy Noonan and *Saint John Paul the Great* by Jason Evert about him. Then at the end of May 2021—with high recommendation from [[Fr. Dailey]]—I felt prompted to pick it up and dive in. What an adventure!

The years 2018–2020 were for reading William Manchester's *[[2018-07-11-Last Lion—Visions of Glory|The Last Lion]]* trilogy on Churchill[^churchill], and now the years 2021–2023 can be for reading Weigel's John Paul II trilogy.

[^churchill]: Churchill, by the way, is perhaps the one other figure who may have claim to be the greatest figure of the 20th century apart from John Paul II, a thought I had while finishing *[[2021-08-02-Team of Rivals#^2b09ad]]*.

I love reading biographies because it is simultaneously the story of a person and the history of the world they inhabited. This here is not only the story of John Paul II, but also a history of Poland's "double defeat" in World War II by the Nazi's and subsequent Communist rule, the most lucid history of Vatican II and its implementation I have yet encountered, and a fascinating view into the workings of the Holy See. 


Themes:
- Christian humanism and anthropology as a response to the dangers of modernity
- Speaking truth to power, the power of hope, and how there is no fear if we are rooted in Christ
- Always propose, never impose
