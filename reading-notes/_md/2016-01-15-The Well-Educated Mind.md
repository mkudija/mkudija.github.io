# *The Well-Educated Mind* by [[Susan Wise Bauer]]

* Chapter 1 - Training Your Mind
    * From Jefferson: we can fill our “chasms of time” (14) with useful study
    * [[Mortimer Adler]]: reading allows us to participate in the “[[Great Conversation]]” of ideas (16)
    * Francis Bacon: “Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested” (18)
    * [[Classical Education]] is divided into three stages, the [[Trivium]]
        * grammar: foundational knowledge
        * logic: analyze
        * rhetoric: express your own opinion
    * She emphasizes the importance of being deliberate and focused
        * “Engage no the mind in the intense pursuit of too many things at once” - Isaac Watts (20)
        * Friedrich [[Schleiermacher]] described that wide-ranging, unsystematic reading left his mind “like Chaos, before the world was created (21)
    * Set a time for study
        * morning
        * 4 days per week
    * Don’t focus on visible achievement, but on the act of thinking
* Chapter 2 - The Act of Reading
    * “to be enlightened is to understand an idea and use it to make sense of the facts you’ve gathered” (25)
    * concern about speed:
        * 1. reading is the life-long process, so you don’t need to do it all now
        * 2. serious reading is not trying to assimilate as much info as possible, but to understand a few important ideas
    * But, some points from speed readers may be helpful
        * 1. move your eyes smoothly across the page
        * 2. scan the page for context
        * 3. “prior knowledge makes reading easier” should be encouraging: read chronologically and it gets easier
* Chapter 3 - Keep a Journal
    * “What we write, we remember. What we summarize in our own words becomes our own.” (36)
    * journal for self-education should be modeled after “commonplace book”: quotes and snippets you want to remember
        * 1. jot down notes/quotes as you read
        * 2. after reading, write a brief summary of what you read
        * 3. white your own thoughts/questions
    * “He who is seeking to know himself should be ever seeking himself in external things” -Bronson Alcott (37)
    * the goal is to not stuff facts in your head but to understand them
    * Lydia Sigourney: “At the close of every week, abridge in writing, the subjects that you deem most valuable” (38)
    * Notes while reading
        * 1. Write the title of the chapter. Read the whole chapter without stopping. Write down phrases that stand out to you
        * 2. Summarize each section in your own words
        * 3. Glance over your summaries and write your reactions
* Chapter 4 - Final Preparations
    * serious reading is hard work: but can be broken down into manageable steps
    * Grammar
        * Just read and keep reading
        * Underline and take notes on your book
        * When first starting read: title page, table of contents, back cover, preface if by the author/translator (but not others who would be offering an opinion before you get to see the text)
        * Don’t take extensive notes on first reading. Stop at end of each chapter and write a sentence
        * Jot down questions as you read
        * Assemble your summary sentences into an informal outline
        * Give the book a title (4-7 words) and descriptive title to capture what it is really about
    * Logic
        * Reread the difficult and important sections
        * Dig deeper into the book’s structure
        * Ask: How well did the writer succeed?
    * Rhetoric
        * So what? What does the writer want to you do/believe/experience?
        * Engage in purposeful conversation to fix knowledge firmly in the memory
            * book groups
            * find one other person who will read with you and discuss with you
            * discussions by letter can be helpful if you are formal and purposeful in your writing
        * You can check up on other people’s opinions of works after you read: Modern Critical Essays
            * stop by a professor at a local university
    * Notes on her lists by category
        * “When you read chronologically, you reunite two fields that should never have been separated in the first place: history and literature” (51)
            * it provides you with a continuous story
        * Don’t feel bound by the lists: add or subtract to match your interests
            * Also pick how much to focus on each: some to digest
