## Introduction

- Your life has at least 10 interrelated domains:
  1. Spiritual
  2. Intellectual
  3. Emotional
  4. Physical
  5. Marital
  6. Parental
  7. Social
  8. Vocational
  9. Avocational (hobbies)
  10. Financial
- Every domain matters
- Progress starts only when you get clear on where you are right now
- You can improve any life domain
- Confidence, happiness, and life satisfaction are byproducts of personal growth


## Step 1 - Believe the Possibility

### Chapter 1 - Your Beliefs Shape Your Reality

- Transform your ***Limiting Beliefs*** into ***Liberating Truths***


### Chapter 2 - Some Beliefs Hold You Back

- Transform your ***Scarcity Thinking*** into ***Abundance Thinking***
- Limiting beliefs are:
  - Black-and-white (think we fail if not perfect)
  - Personalizing (blame ourselves for failures)
  - Catastrophizing (assume the worst with little evidence)
  - Universalizing (assume something bad is true across the board) 


### Chapter 3 - You Can Upgrade Your Beliefs

1. Recognize the limiting belief
2. Record the belief (to externalize it and allow your to evaluate it)
3. Review the belief (is it empowering?)
4. Reject or reframe the belief
5. Revise the belief (reorient your thinking around a liberating truth)
6. Reorient yourself to the new belief (live from the perspective of this liberating truth)

## Step 2 - Complete the Past

### Chapter 4 - Thinking Backward Is a Must

- Completing the past is an essential part of designing a better future
- After-Action Review
  1. State what you wanted to happen
  2. Acknowledge what actually happened
  3. Learn from the experience
  4. Adjust your behavior 


### Chapter 5 - Regret Reveals Opportunity

- Benefits of regret include information, motivation to change, and integrity (moral compass)
- **The Opportunity Principle**: we feel regret the strongest when opportunity for improvement is the greatest; what if you biggest frustrations from last year could be pointing to your biggest wins of this year?


### Chapter 6 - Gratitude Makes the Difference

- Gratitude keeps you *hopeful*, *reminds us we have agency*, *improves our patience*, and *expands our possible responses* by moving us to a place of abundance
- Michael's Gratitude Disciplines
  1. Start and end the day with prayer
  2. Practice thankfulness (at natural points such as prayer before meals)
  3. Journal about gratitude


## Step 3 - Design Your Future

### Chapter 7 - Great Goals Check Seven Boxes

**"SMARTER" Goals**
1. **Specific**
2. **Measurable**
3. **Actionable**
4. **Risky** (don't set the bar too low)
5. **Time-Keyed** (deadline or frequency)
6. **Exciting** (inspire you)
7. **Relevant**


### Chapter 8 - Achievements and Habits Work Together

- Habit goal time keys
  1. Start date
  2. Habit frequency
  3. Time trigger (when to perform, for consistency)
  4. Streak target 


### Chapter 9 - Seriously, Risk Is Your Friend

- Three Zones
  - **Comfort Zone**: goals should be beyond our comfort zone
  - **Discomfort Zone**: this is where growth happens
  - **Delusional Zone**: set a goal that's *almost* delusional, then dial it back a few clicks


## Step 4 - Find Your Way

### Chapter 10 - Your What Need a Why

- List your key motivations (5-7 bullets)
- Connect with your motivations *intellectually* and *emotionally*


### Chapter 11 - You Can Master Your Own Motivation

- Focus on *intrinsic* and internalize the rewards from achieving your goals
- Think of habit goals as serving larger achievement goals to keep you motivated
- Track and extend your streaks, or gamify your habit to make it fun
- Measure your progress to inspire your perseverance


### Chapter 12 - The Journey Is Better With Friends

- Others can help you achieve your gaols through *learning*, *encouragement*, *accountability*, and *competition*


## Step 5 - Make It Happen

### Chapter 13 - One Journey Is Many Steps

- First, you have to just *start*
- Do the easiest task first to lower the threshold for taking action, boost your mood with quick wins, and build momentum
- Schedule it and commit to act


### Chapter 14 - You Can Trigger Success

- *Activation triggers* or *implementation intentions*: simple statements and processes that streamline the process of reaching our goals; if-then
  1. Brainstorm your best triggers
  2. Optimize them (when you're at your strongest)
  3. Anticipate obstacles and determine your response
  4. Experiment 


### Chapter 15 - Visibility Is Essential

- Daily Review
- Weekly Review
- Quarterly Review
  - **Rejoice** if you reached your goal
  - **Recommit** if you're not there yet
  - **Revise** the goal if you can't recommit
  - **Remove** the goal if you can't revise
  - **Replace** the goal if you remove it

### The LEAP Principle

- **Never leave the scene of clarity without taking decisive action**
- LEAP
  - *Lean* into the change
  - *Engage* until you achieve clarity
  - *Activate* and do something
  - *Pounce* and do it now
