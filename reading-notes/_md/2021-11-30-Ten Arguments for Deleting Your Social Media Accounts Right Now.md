>_**BUMMER**: Behaviors of Users Modified, and Made into an Empire for Rent_

### Argument 1: You are losing your free will
- What used to be called advertising is now **continuous behavior modification**
- Randomization helps with optimization of algorithms and contributes to their addictive nature  


### Argument 2: Quitting social media is the most finely targeted way to resist the insanity of our times
- The problem isn’t smartphones or the internet, but business models that rely on individual behavior change  
- **BUMMER** acronym: "Behaviors of Users Modified, and Made into an Empire for Rent"
- Components of the BUMMER machine
	- Attention Acquisition leading to Asshole supremacy
	- Butting into everyone's lives
	- Cramming content down people's throats
	- Directing people's behaviors in the sneakiest way possible
	- Earning money from letting the worst assholes secretly screw with everyone else
	- Fake mobs and Faker society


### Argument 3: Social media is making you into an asshole
- Trump: “he is not acting like the most powerful person in the world because his addiction [to Twitter] is more powerful”  
- Choose technologies based on the person you become around them 
- Since social media has taken off, assholes have a bigger say in the world  


### Argument 4: Social media is undermining truth
- “Fake people are the cultural version of a DDOS attack”  
  

### Argument 5: Social media is making what you say meaningless
- BUMMER replaces your context with the platform's context  
  

### Argument 6: Social media is destroying your capacity for empathy  
- Customized feeds remove our social cohesion since we are all looking at something different  
- The version of the world you are seeing is invisible to the people who misunderstand you, and *vise versa*
- We seen crazy to each other because BUMMER is robbing us of our "theories of mind"
  

### Argument 7: Social media is making you unhappy
- Social media robs us of the ability to carve out a space to invent oneself without constant judgment  
  

### Argument 8: Social media doesn't want you to have economic dignity
- BUMMER agreement: "let us spy on you and you’ll get free services"
  
 
### Argument 9: Social media is making politics impossible
- MLK’s arc of progress of history is collapsing  
 

### Argument 10: Social media hates your soul
- “Spirituality can usually coexist a little more easily with [[Enlightenment]] [ways of learning not subservient to human power hierarchies] thinking” (130)
	- "The cultures of sciences and engineering used to embrace [[Enlightenment]] epistemology, but now they have been overridden by horribly regressive BUMMER epistemology." (130)  
- “The foundation of the search for truth must be the ability acknowledge one’s own ignorance”  
- BUMMER replaces spirituality with its own designs  
- “This is not just metaphysics, but metaphysical imperialism”  
- AI is a fantasy, it has no objective criteria for success  
- The fundamental question is *“what is a person”* (137)
	- How he reconciles his views "on the specialness of people with my support of [[Abortion]] rights": [The Latest Innocent Embryo to Protect: Harriet Miers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-latest-innocent-embry_b_8547)
	- [[Secular Religion]]: "The BUMMER business is interwoven with a new religion that grants empathy to computer programs—calling them AI programs—as a way to avoid noticing that it is degrading the dignity, stature, and rights of real humans." (138)


### Conclusion  
- You can’t use the internet well until you’ve encountered it on your own terms
