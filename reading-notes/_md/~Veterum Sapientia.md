[Veterum Sapientia (vatican.va)](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-xxiii/la/apost_constitutions/1962/documents/hf_j-xxiii_apc_19620222_veterum-sapientia.html)

- The wisdom of the ancient world, enshrined in Greek and Roman literature, and the truly memorable teaching of ancient peoples, served, surely, to herald the dawn of the Gospel which Gods Son, ‚Äúthe judge and teacher of grace and truth, the light and guide of the human race,‚Äù proclaimed on earth. (1)
- "The Church has ever held the literary evidences of this wisdom in the highest esteem. She values especially the [[Greek]] and [[Latin]] languages in which wisdom itself is cloaked, as it were, in a vesture of gold."
- "But amid this variety of languages a primary place must surely be given to that language which had its origins in Latium, and later proved so admirable a means for the spreading of Christianity throughout the West. And since in God‚Äôs special Providence this language united so many nations together under the authority of the Roman Empire ‚Äî and that for so many centuries ‚Äî it also became the rightful language of the Apostolic See. Preserved for posterity, it proved to be a bond of unity for the Christian peoples of Europe."
- Latin "presents itself with equal impartiality to all and is equally acceptable to all" and is of "characteristic nobility".
- Thus the ‚Äúknowledge and use of this language,‚Äù so intimately bound up with the Church‚Äôs life, ‚Äúis important not so much on cultural or literary grounds, as for religious reasons‚Äù...‚ÄúFor the Church, precisely because it embraces all nations and is destined to endure to the end of time ‚Ä¶ of its very nature requires a language which is **universal**, **immutable**, and **non-vernacular**.‚Äù (cf *[[~Officiorum omnium|Epist. Ap. Officiorum omnium]]*)
- The Latin language is:
	- a "treasure of incomparable worth"
	- a "general passport to the proper understanding of the Christian writers of antiquity and the documents of the Church's teaching"
	- a "most effective bond, binding the Church of today with that of the past and of the future in wonderful continuity"
	- a "a most effective training for the pliant minds of youth"
- "We are fully determined to restore this language to its position of honor, and to do all We can to promote its study and use"
- "The greatest zeal should be shown in the acquisition of whatever educates and ennobles the mind. Otherwise poor mortal creatures may well become like the machines they build ‚Äî cold, hard, and devoid of love."
- "In the exercise of their paternal care they shall be on their guard lest anyone under their jurisdiction, eager for revolutionary changes, writes against the use of Latin in the teaching of the higher sacred studies or **in the Liturgy**, or through prejudice makes light of the Holy See‚Äôs will in this regard or interprets it falsely."
- "No one is to be admitted to the study of philosophy or theology except he be thoroughly grounded in this language and capable of using it."
- "The traditional method of teaching this language shall be completely restored...Should circumstances of time and place demand the addition of other subjects to the curriculum besides the usual ones, then either the course of studies must be lengthened, or these additional subjects must be condensed or their study relegated to another time."
- "The major sacred sciences shall be taught in Latin, which, as we know from many centuries of use, must be considered most suitable for explaining with the utmost facility and clarity the most difficult and profound ideas and concepts. For apart from the fact that it has long since been enriched with a vocabulary of appropriate and unequivocal terms, best calculated to safeguard the integrity of the Catholic faith, it also serves in no slight measure to prune away useless verbiage." 
- "Hence professors of these sciences in universities or seminaries are required to speak Latin and to make use of textbooks written in Latin. If ignorance of Latin makes it difficult for some to obey these instructions, they shall gradually be replaced by professors who are suited to this task. Any difficulties that may be advanced by students or professors must be overcome by the patient insistence of the bishops or religious superiors, and the good will of the professors."
- Calls for a Latin Academy to furnish "new words that are apt and suitable for expressing modern things."
- "Latin is closely allied to [[Greek]] both in formal structure and in the importance of its extant writings. Hence ‚Äî as Our Predecessors have frequently ordained ‚Äî future ministers of the altar must be instructed in Greek in the lower and middle schools. Thus when they come to study the higher sciences ‚Äî and especially if they are aiming for a degree in Sacred Scripture or theology ‚Äî they will be enabled to follow the Greek sources of scholastic philosophy and understand them correctly; and not only these, but also the original texts of Sacred Scripture, the Liturgy, and the sacred Fathers." (cf. *[[2025-05-30-Providentissimus Deus|Providentissimus Deus]]*)
