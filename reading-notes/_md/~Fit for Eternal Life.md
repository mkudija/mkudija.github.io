## Foreword
- "The Church, without any doubt whatever, approves of physical culture, if it be in proper proportion." ([[Pope Pius XII]])

## Introduction
- To become truly fit, healthful exercise and eating behaviors must become *habitual*. (xxvii)
- Acquiring good habits means acquiring [[virtues]]
- God wants us to be perfect in our human natures: soul, mind, and *body*

# Part I: Body, Mind, and Spirit

## Chapter 1: Introducing Total Fitness
- Fitness is simple: "rock science, not rocket science" (8)
- Total fitness is a matter of knowledge, will, and daily practice (10)


## Chapter 2: The Virtues of Fitness
- The cultivation of virtue allows us to combat weakness and overcome the discouragement of pain (16)
- Think of the golden mean not as mediocrity or lukewarmness, but as the gold peak of excellence that towers above deficiency and excess (20)
- We acquire [[Virtues|virtue]] by performing virtuous actions (cf. *[[~Nicomachean Ethics|Nicomachean Ethics]]* [[bib]])


# Part II: The Strength of [[Fortitude]]: Principles of Strength Training

## Chapter 3: Progression Toward Perfection
- Progression is the first key to building muscular strength and size 
	- First progress with additional repetitions with the same weight (8 to 12 reps)
	- Next progress with additional weight (perhaps lowering repetitions)
- [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] calls [[Fortitude]] the guardian of the virtues, preventing our reason from being overcome by physical pain or adversity (31)
- "Progress in physical strength may help give us the confidence to be more courageous in our moral actions, and progress in the virtue of fortitude can help us endure the discomfort of physical training that makes our muscles strong." (31)
- Three kinds of muscular strength: positive (lifting), negative (setting down), static (holding)


## Chapter 4: Intensity for Muscular Immensity
- We want to strive to be decathletes (generalists) of physical and spiritual fitness (37)
- *Intensity* is directly tied to *progress*
- High-Intensity Training maximizes intensity by training to failure (attempt but unable to complete the last repetition) 
	- We have no way of knowing what intensity you are at, unless you hit failureâ€”failure is the way of ensuring high intensity
- "A little bit of something does more that a whole lot of nothing": no amount of low-intensity exercise will produce growth 


## Chapter 5: Duration in Moderation
- Intensity and duration of effort are inversely proportional 
- Aerobic exercise is low enough intensity that muscles can continue to be supplied with oxygen, and is important in strengthening the cardiovascular and respiratory systems
- Anaerobic exercise is high-intensity and fueled by glycogen; this builds muscle 
- Endurance doesn't increase strength, but strength increases endurance 
- Perform only one set per exercise (not a pyramid)


## Chapter 6: Frequency for Results You'll See
- One set per exercise in light of the need to maximal intensity to grow in strength 
- Once per week is a minimum for strength training 
- Individual muscles need to be trained only once per week for maximum size and strength (60)


## Chapter 7: Rest to Grow Best
- Rest is every bit as important as exercise 
- Offer up the pain of your workout for truly suffering souls


## Chapter 8: Form Must Be the Norm
- Form is one of the most important, but most often overlooked, aspects of strength training. Focus on: 
	- Exercise through the muscle's full range of motion 
	- Reasonable speed of motion (2 seconds to raise, 4 seconds to lower)
	- Maintain proper body positioning
