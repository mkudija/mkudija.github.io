## *Winnie-The-Pooh*

## *The House At Pooh Corner*

Real intelligence (131): 
>"Rabbit's clever," said Pooh thoughtfully.
>"Yes," said Piglet, "Rabbit's clever."
>"And he has Brain."
>"Yes," said Piglet, "Rabbit has Brain."
>There was a long silence.
>"I suppose," said Pooh, "that that's why he never understands anything."

[[Poems|Poetry]] (147-148):
>Poetry and Hums aren't things which you get, they're things which get *you*.

[[Fortitude|Courage]] (153):
>"Oh!" said Piglet. "Because Iâ€”I thought I did blinch a little. Just at first. And it says, 'Did he blinch no no.' That's why."
>"You only blinched inside," said Pooh, "and that's the bravest way for a Very Small Animal not to blinch that there is." 


Conclusion (172):
>What do you like doing best in the world, Pooh?"  
>"Well," said Pooh, "what I like best and then he had to stop and think. Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called. And then he thought that being with Christopher Robin was a very good thing to do, and having Piglet near was a very friendly thing to have; and so, when he had thought it all out, he said, "What I like best in the whole world is Me and Piglet going to see You, and You saying What about a little something?' and Me saying, Well, I shouldn't mind little something, should you, Piglet,' and it being a hummy sort of day outside, and birds singing."
