# [*Lumen Gentium: Dogmatic Constitution on the Church*]
*Document of [[Vatican II]], 1964*


## 14 
>**He is not saved, however, who, though part of the body of the Church, does not persevere in charity.** He remains indeed in the bosom of the Church, but, as it were, only in a "bodily" manner and not "in his heart."(12*) All the Church's children should remember that their exalted status is to be attributed not to their own merits but to the special grace of Christ. **If they fail moreover to respond to that grace in thought, word and deed, not only shall they not be saved but they will be the more severely judged.**
