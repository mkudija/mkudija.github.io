- "Share with others the magic of the flywheel effect. One grandmother I spoke with found it difficult to connect with her faraway grandkids on a regular basis. So she ordered a book of knock-knock jokes. Now she calls her grandchildren every day at 4:00 p.m. to read a different one aloud. Sometimes it's just the joke and then we hang up.
