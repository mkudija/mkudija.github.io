# Penseés by Blaise [[Pascal]]

* [[Pascal's wager]]: "I should be much more frightened of being wrong and finding out that the Christian religion was true than of being wrong in believing it to be true." (6)
* [[The unity of the Old and New Testaments]]: "The two Testaments look to Jesus Christ, the Old as its expectation and the New as its model, and both have him as their centre." (7)
* "The true nature of man, his true good, true virtue, and true religion, cannot be known separately." (12)
* "Happiness is neither outside us nor within us. It is God, both outside and within us." (26)
* "Respect means to go out of your way for others." (115)
* "Wisdom leads us back to childhood." (116, cf. [[Mt-18#v3]]: "unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven")
* "Justice without strength is powerless. Strength without justice is tyrannical." (135)
* "I have often said that man's unhappiness springs from one thing alone, his incapacity to stay quietly in one room." (168)
