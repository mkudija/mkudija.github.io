Summary (from *[[2023-03-31-Christianity and Politics#^be1114|Christianity and Politics]]*):
- This work revolutionized the relationship between Christianity and Politics 
- Parts 1-2 (Books 1-10): the pagan God's never brought Rome health or happiness and were logically incapable of doing so
- Parts 3-5 (Books 11-22): only the Christian God can save Rome 

# Part One  
## Book I
*The gods did not protect Rome. The Christians suffered with others, but disasters overtake both good and bad, and the loss of worldly goods is not always a disaster. The violation of chastity does not harm the unwilling soul. Suicide is not permissible to avoid this.*

- cf [[Mt-06#v19]]-[[Mt-06#v21]] (18)

## Book II
*The pagan gods had no moral teaching to give. Examples of the obscenity of pagan rites drawn from Augustine's experience, The gods not only tolerated but even demanded obscenity on the stage. Sallust gave a picture of Rome's decadence. First appearance of Scripio's definition of a state. Cicero's judgement. Further account of obscenities in public worship.*  

**Book II, Chapter 1**: 

**Book II, Chapter 2**: Summary of matters treated in Book I
>For in the ruin of the city it was stone and timber which fell to the ground; but in the lives of those Romans we saw the collapse not of material but of moral defences, not of material but of spiritual grandeur. The lust that burned in their hearts was more deadly than the flame which consumed their dwellings. (49)

## Book VI
*Gods are not worshipped for their gift of eternal life. Varro and 'mythical' and 'civil' deities. 'M. Varro, you are the shrewdest of men and without doubt the most erudite' (Bk VI, 6,). The absurd small gods. They do not even help temporal life.*

## Book VIlI

The worship of 'demons' rejected (Apuleius - Hermes Trismegistus). The pagan cult of the dead and the Christian cult of martyrs. Pagan sacrifice and the one and only true Christian victim.*

**Book IX, Chapter 20**: 
- "Against this arrogance of the demons, to which mankind was enslaved as a deserved punishment, is set the [[Humility|humility]] of God, revealed in Christ. But the power of humility is unknown to men whose souls are inflated with the impurity of inflated pride. They resemble the demons in arrogance, but not in knowledge." (366)

**Book IX, Chapter 21**: 

**Book IX, Chapter 22**: 

**Book IX, Chapter 23**:

**Book X, Chapter 12**: 
>And whatever miracle happens in this world, it is certainly a lesser marvel than the whole world, that is to say, the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, which God undoubtedly made. But the manner of its making is as hidden from man and as incomprehensible to man as is he who made it. And so although the miracles of the visible world of nature have lost their value for us because we see them continually, still, if we observe them wisely they will be found to be greater miracles than the most extraordinary and unusual events. For man is a greater miracle than any miracle effected by man's agency. (390)

>Thus he is both the priest, himself making the offering, and the oblation. This is the reality, and he intended the daily sacrifice of the Church to be the sacramental symbol of this; for the Church, being the body of which he is the head, learns to offer itself through him. This is the true sacrifice (401)

- Science/Physics: "It is a great achievement, and no everyday matter, that man in his speculation should go beyond the created universe, having examined it, both in its material and immaterial aspects, and found it mutable, and arrive at the immutable being of God; and then should learn from him that everything which exists, apart from God himself, is the creation of God, and of him alone."

**Book XII, Chapter 7**: 

**Book XII, Chapter 8**: 
- "[[Lust]] is not something wrong in a beautiful and attractive body; the fault is in a soul which perversely delights in sensual pleasures, to the neglect of that self-control by which we are made fit for spiritual realities far more beautiful, with a loveliness which cannot fade. Boasting is not something wrong with the praise of men; the fault is in a soul which perversely loves the praise of others and cares nothing for the 'witness of conscience. [[Pride]] is not something wrong in the one who loves power, or in the power itself; the fault is in the soul which perversely loves its own power, and has no thought for the justice of the Omnipotent."

- "Now God is present everywhere in his entirety, and so does not move from one place to another; but he is said to 'come down' when he performs an action which is miraculous in being contrary to the ordinary course of nature, and thus in some way points to his presence." (658)

**Book XVI, Chapter 6**: 
- [[Gn-01#v26]]: "There is another passage which might have been interpreted with reference to the angels; it is the place where, at the creation of man, God said, 'Let us make man',*" instead of 'Let me make man.' However, since this is followed by 'in our image', and since it is unthinkable that we should believe man to have been made in the image of the angels, or that the angels and God have the same image, the plural here is correctly understood to refer to the Trinity. Nevertheless, the Trinity is one God, and therefore even after the words 'Let us make' the narrative proceeds: 'And God made man in the image of God' It does not say, 'The gods made' or, 'in the image of the gods'."

- "The reckoning of their dates is not to be found in the sacred writings which are called 'canonical', but in other documents, which include the books of the Maccabees. These are regarded as canonical by the Church (though not by the Jews) because of the savage, the amazing sufferings endured by some of the martyrs who, before Christ's coming in his human body, contended even unto death for the cause of God's Law, and held firm under the most appalling agonies."

**Book XVIII, Chapter 38**: Some writings not admitted into the canon because of their great antiquity and doubtful authenticity
- Enoch: "...on account of their remoteness in time it seemed advisable to hold them suspect, for fear of advancing false claims to authenticity. For there are some writings put forward as genuine works of those authors by those who without discrimination believe what they want to believe, as suits their inclination...they are of no value even as adding to our supply of knowledge since it is uncertain whether they are authentic works of the authors to whom they are ascribed."

- Inspiration of the Hebrew OT as well as the [[Septuagint]]: "For the very same Spirit that was in the prophets when they uttered their messages was at work also in the seventy scholars when they translated them. And the Spirit could have said something else as well, with divine authority, as if the prophet had said both things, because it was the same Spirit that said both. The Spirit could also have said the same thing in a different way, so that even though the words were not the same, the same meaning would still shine through to those who properly understood them. He could also have omitted something, or added something, so that it might be shown in this way too that the task of translation was achieved not by the servile labour of a human bond-servant of words, but by the power of God which filled and directed the mind of the translator." (821) ^06deea
- "If then we see, as we ought to see, nothing in those Scriptures except the utterances of the Spirit of God through the mouths of men, it follows that anything in the Hebrew text that is not found in that of the seventy translators is something which the Spirit of God decided not to say through the translators but through the prophets. Conversely, anything in the Septuagint that is not in the Hebrew texts is something which the same Spirit preferred to say through the translators, instead of through the prophets, thus showing that the former and the latter alike were prophets. For in the same way the Spirit spoke, as he chose, some things through Isaiah, others through Jeremiah, others through one prophet or another; or he said the same things, differently expressed, through this prophet and that."

**Book XXI, Chapter 26**: The meaning of having Christ as the foundation, and of 'saved by fire'
- "Now we shall discover who can be saved 'through fire', if we start by discovering what it means to have Christ as one's foundation. To get at the meaning as quickly as possible from the metaphor itself: the foundation precedes any of the building; and so if anyone has Christ in his heart in the sense that he puts no earthly and temporal thing before Christ - not even those which are lawful and permitted - that man has Christ as his foundation. If he does put such things before Christ, then even if he appears to hold the Christian faith, Christ is not the foundation in him, since for him Christ takes second place. And if he thinks nothing of the saving commandments and acts unlawfully, he is all the more convicted of putting Christ last instead of first, when he has relegated him to secondary importance as a source of command or permission, and has slighted his commands or his permission in choosing to gratify his sensuality by immoral acts. And so, if a Christian loves a harlot and becomes one body with her by linking himself to her', he no longer has Christ for his foundation, whereas if a man loves his wife, assuming that he loves her according to Christ's standards, then who can doubt that he has Christ as his foundation? But if he loves her in the way of the world, with a sensual love, with an unhealthy lust, in the manner of 'the pagans who are ignorant of God', even this the Apostle allows by way of indulgence, or rather Christ does so through his apostle, It is possible, then, for such a man to have Christ as his foundation. For provided that he does not put any such sensual pleasure before the claims of Christ, then although he builds in wood, hay, and straw', Christ is the foundation, and for that reason he will be saved 'through fire'. For pleasures of this kind and the earthly sort of love, which because of the bond of marriage do not incur damnation, will nevertheless be burnt up by the fire of tribulation; and bereavement and any other calamities which put an end to such pleasures are all connected with this "fire. And in this way the building will bring loss to the builder in that he will not keep what he has built on the foundation and he will be tormented by the loss of the enjoyment that certainly gave him delight. Yet he will be saved 'through fire' in virtue of that foundation, because if a persecutor had given him the choice between having that enjoyment and having Christ, he would have chosen Christ in preference to those delights. Now listen to the Apostle describing a man who builds gold, silver, precious stones, on this foundation. The unmarried man', he says, gives his thoughts to the Lord's affairs; his aim is to please the Lord'; and then describing the builder in wood, hay and straw, The married man, in contrast, concentrates on worldly matters; his concern is how to please his wife...**fire will test the quality of each man's work**" (1010-1012)
- "But anyone who puts any loved objects before Christ does not have Christ for his foundation, am not speaking only of a man's wife, when he treats her as a means of sensual pleasure in carnal copulation; I am referring also to those relationships of natural affection where there is no question of such sensual indulgence. If a man loves any member of his family, with a human being's instinctive affection, in such a way as to put Christ second, then Christ is not his foundation, and for that reason such a man will not be 'saved by fire', because it will be impossible for him to be with the Saviour. Indeed Christ made a most explicit statement on this point when he said, 'Anyone who loves his father or his mother more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who loves a son or a daughter more than me is not worthy of me.'o On the other hand, anyone who loves those close relations in this instinctive way, without putting them in front of the Lord Christ, anyone who would prefer to be deprived of them rather than to lose Christ, if he were brought to the test of this dilemma, such a man will be 'saved through fire', because the loss of those loved ones will cause him burning pain in proportion to the closeness of his attachment to them. But we may add that anyone who loves father or mother, sons or daughters according to the standards of Christ, so that he is concerned that they may inherit Christ's kingdom and be united to Christ, or anyone who loves them for the fact that they are members of Christ; it is impossible that such affection should prove to be something that has to be destroyed along with the 'wood, hay and straw. This will, beyond dispute, be reckoned as part of the structure of 'gold, silver, and precious stone. For if a man loves others entirely for Christ's sake, how can he love them more than Christ?" (1014)

**Book XXI, Chapter 27**:
- "Anyone who loves Christ in a Christian gives help to that Christian with the intention of coming closer to Christ, not of escaping from Christ unpunished." (1017)
