	 * >Read the first book of Livy's History of Rome. Or read Gerard O'Daly's Readers Guide to City of God. Or just get a head start! ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ccpecknold/status/800076033999257600))
* Book I
    * 9 talks about how good and bad are punished together because good loves the world and is afraid to admonish bad. This reminded me of the priest in Arizona who preached against voting for Democrats who support abortion. How are we called in family life to love in this culture without giving into its vices and make sure we admonish sin when we confront it?

	 * >It is a great achievement, and no everyday matter, that man in his speculation should go beyond the created universe, having examined it, both in its material and immaterial aspects, and fount it mutable, and arrive at the immutable being of God; and then should learn from him that everything which exists, apart from God himself, is the creation of God, and of him alone.
 * "To cut a long story short"...ironic that this appears on page 1036 [#CivDei](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CivDei?src=hashtag_click) 22.8
