    * 9 talks about how good and bad are punished together because good loves the world and is afraid to admonish bad. This reminded me of the priest in Arizona who preached against voting for Democrats who support abortion. How are we called in family life to love in this culture without giving into its vices and make sure we admonish sin when we confront it?
