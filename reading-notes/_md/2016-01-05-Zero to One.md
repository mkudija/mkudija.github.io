`(New York: Currency, 2014), 225`


* Zero to one means creating something instead of incremental improvement: build something new 
    * Must offer at lest a 10x improvement on what exists to not be just an incremental improvement 
* "What important truth do few people agree with you on?"
* Monopoly is critical for success: start in a small market that you can dominate 
* Success is not built on luck, or being ready for everything. Instead, identify what is really important and do that. 
* Protect monopoly through network effects, economies of scale, and branding 
* Globalization is doomed without technological innovation
