## Foreword
*by [[Archduke Eduard Karl von Habsburg]]*
- "The most astounding fact is that Emperor Karl excelled in all three areas [as a soldier, politician, and family man]. 'Excelling' does not mean that he was successful in his endeavors but rather that he approached all of his roles with the best intent and carried out his duties under the influence of an guided by religious values. One of his guidelines was to seek God's will in all and everything he was undertaking and to strive to fulfill it in the best possible way." (ix-x)
- "He was the only head of state in the First World War who had firsthand knowledge of what soldiers had to go through when they were sent to war." (x)
- "His *Manifesto to my peoples* is clear proof that he saw the principle of [[subsidiarity]] as a leitmotif for a supranational order." (xi)
- "From his life, we can learn that it is not necessarily the results or the achievements that count but the will to try to do what is right. And if the rewards don't come immediately, there is not need for despair; if we live rightly, we can trust in God's promise that they will come later in the form of heavenly blessings." (xi-xii)
