`(New York: TAN Books, 2014-08), 1052`

- "St. Catherine's familiarity with Jesus, the Incarnate Word, is unique, even among saints favored with unusual gifts and visions. He even walked with her at times and joined her in the saying of the Divine Office. She would bow toward Him at the 'Glory Be,' saying 'Glory be to the Father and to *Thee* and to the Holy Ghost.'" (419) ^d5f8f5
