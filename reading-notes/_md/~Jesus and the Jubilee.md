## Introduction: Our Need for Jubilee 
- Use the Bishop's forgiveness of Jean Valjean in *[[~Les Miserables|Les Miserables]]* as an image for the Jubilee: "I have bought your soul for God." (2)
- "God created a world of peace and harmony that is shattered, and the rest of the [[The Bible|biblical story]] recounts his relentless attempts to restore his original order." (3)
- God established the year of jubilee as a year of favor where we experience the goods of *forgiveness*, *freedom*, *family*, and *fullness*. (4)
- With Jesus all that has been promised is fulfilled. (5)
- The Jubilee lies at the heart of God's plan for our salvation (5) and we want to undersatnd this so that "this great year of favor doesn't pass by leaving us unchanged." (7)

## Chapter 1: Back the the Garden: *Creation as the Model of the Jubilee*
_**Summary**: The Jubilee is an act of restoration to the Good Creation._
- God created the Garden of Eden as a temple under the authority of man, who is the crown of his creation. Adam had five roles in this temple: son of God, king, priest, prophet, and bridegroom. (13)
- By letting the serpent into the garden, Adam failed in his priestly duty to *guard* the temple. (14)
- Keep in mind the original goods of creation which are the blueprint of the jubilee and a sign of what God desires for us. (17)

## Chapter 2: The First Jubilee: *Israel's Exodus from Egypt*
_**Summary**: Spiritual freedom always precedes physical freedom as we see in the Exodus from Egypt, where God first exorcises and frees Israel from slavery to the Egyptian gods (demons)._
- Sidenote: God's original plan for Moses was to use his authority as price of Egypt to help Israel escape their bondage. (22)
- The ten plagues were an *exorcism* of Egypt, a *theomachy* (divine combat) between the true God of Israel and the false gods of Egypt. Each plague targets a specific demon and makes them into a mockery. (24-25)
- Spiritual freedom always precedes physical freedom in jubilee thought. (27)


## Chapter 3: Laws of Liberation: *The Structure That Sustains Freedom*
_**Summary**: The Laws given by God are designed to lead us to freedom._
- "There is a paradox in the human condition: we feel like boundaries (laws) restrict our freedom, but if we fail to observe good boundaries (laws), we end up losing our freedom to sin and addiction...[[True freedom]] means directing our will to what is good. It means directing our will to God, for he is *the* good from where all good and freedom flows. And this takes structure. It takes boundaries. But most importantly, it requires discipline to say no to our own desires that enslave us—to denounce our own will." (31)
- Pg 33+ is a reflection on the [[Ten Commandments]], which were (before the Jubilee laws), aimed at freedom for God's people.


## Chapter 4: Liberty Lost and Regained (Forever): *The Calf and the Jubilee Laws*
_**Summary**: The Jubilee laws facilitate redemption, release, return, and rest._
- "Moses got the people out of Egypt, but he hadn't gotten Egypt out of the people." The laws given in Lev 1-16 for liturgy and Lev 17-27 for lifestyle are designed to de-Egyptianize them—the sacrifices slay animals that symbolized Egyptian gods. (41-42)
- [[Lv-25#v1]]-9 commands that every seventh year to be a year of rest.
- [[Lv-25#v10]]-25 commands that every fiftieth year be a special Jubilee of redemption, release, return, and rest. 
- The Jubilee begins on the Day of Atonement because the liberation begins with *spiritual liberation*. (44)


## Chapter 5: Jubilee in Theory...and Practice: *Did the Israelites Actually Observe the Jubilee?*
_**Summary**: Israel did not in fact observe the Jubilee as intended, leading them to exile and requiring them to wait for the Messiah to proclaim the final jubilee._
- Did the Israelites Actually Observe the Jubilee? Not very well: we have very little evidence they did at all apart from the first one or two. (49)
- [[Is-37#v30]]-32: God asks the remnant to observe the Jubilee year and to step our in faith and trust in his fullness. (51)
- Jeremiah observes the laws of the jubilee by acting as *go'el* (kinsmen-redeemer): there is still Jubilee hope even when it looks like all is lost from the invading armies of Babylon. (52)
- The long overdue observance of the Jubilee was Zedekiah's release of Jewish slaves ([[Jer-34#v8]]-10), but this was quickly reversed when the threat subsided. (53)
- The seventy year length of the exile corresponds to a "make-up" for the five hundred years when Israel failed to observe the Jubilee. (54, cf. [[2 Chr-36#v20]]-21)
- [[Is-61#v1]]-2 indicates that the Jubilee would only be fulfilled when the Messiah came and announced it, and he would also be the *go'el* or redeemer of his people. (56)
- The whole chronology of [[Dn-09#v24]]-27 is based on the Jubilee cycles: at the end of ten jubilees, the Messiah would arrive to proclaim the final jubilee of history. (60)


## Chapter 6: Miracle at Qumran: *Hard Evidence for the Jubilee*
_**Summary**: Shortly before Jesus' coming the Essens had meditated upon these prophecies and become convinced that a divine Melchizedek would return after ten jubilee cycles._
- The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] include a complete book of [[Isaiah]] dating from the 200s BC, compared with the previously known oldest copy from the 900s AD. (62, cf *[[~Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls|Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls]]*)
- The Essene author of 11QMelchizedek combined interpretations of [[Lv-25|Leviticus 25]], [[Dt-15|Deuteronomy 15]], [[Is-61|Isaiah 61]], and [[Dn-09|Daniel 9]] into a prophecy about the final judgement and identifies the Messiah as Melchizedek, who will proclaim to them jubilee, thus releasing them from the debt of all their sins. (65-67)
- This shows how shortly before Jesus' coming the Essens had meditated upon these prophecies and become convinced that a divine Melchizedek would return after ten jubilee cycles to make atonement for God's faithful remnant and release them from sin. (69)


## Chapter 7: A Year of Favor: *The Coming of Christ, the New Melchizedek*
_**Summary**: Christ is the New Melchizedek, the high priest who frees his people from their sins through the Sacraments, which are the ordinary way in which we experience the Jubilee._
- David's throne first belonged to [[Melchizedek]] who founded the city of Salem that became Jerusalem (72). Jesus read [[Is-61#v1]]-2 which the Essenes identified with the return of the divine Melchizedek (73).
- Christ created the Church and appointed priests of the order of Melchizedek to proclaim liberty and free people from slavery to Satan and debt to sin. The main theme of [[Hebrews]] is how Jesus is the high priest of the order of Melchizedek. (78)
- Christ established the sacraments by which sin is vanquished. The "seventy times seven" in [[Mt-18#v21]]-22 about forgiveness (confession) is Jubilee language, a perfect set of ten jubilee cycles. (79)
- John identifies the Passion as the great exorcism of Satan: "he spoke of the temple of his body" in [[Jn-02#v18]]-21, and the "most holy place" or "holy of holies" in [[Dn-09#v24]] can be interpreted as the temple of his body. (81)
- The Feast of Tabernacles celebrates the supernatural river of life from [[Ez-47#v1]]-12 (and [[Jl-03#v18]], [[Zec-13#v1]], 14:8). In the context of this feast Jesus says that "Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water." ([[Jn-07#v37]]-38)
- The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of freedom, the Spirit of jubilee, flows from the Passion of Christ. The Sacraments are the usual way in which we experience jubilee, which flows from Christ through his body, the Church. (88)
