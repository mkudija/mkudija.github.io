I bought this off Amazon for $4 back in June of 2015 when I was living in LA. I forget why I bought it then but it was perhaps after listening to *John Paul II: A Personal Portrait of the Pope and the Man* by Ray Flynn. Its great bulk sat on my shelf through three moves while I continued to read some other titles by John Paul II (*Rise, Let Us Be On Our Way*, *[[2019-12-23-Centesimus Annus|Centesimus Annus]]*, *Theology of the Body*, and *The Jeweler's Shop*) or about him (*[[2019-03-10-Lead Yourself First|Lead Yourself First]]* by Raymond Kethledge, *John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father* by Peggy Noonan and *Saint John Paul the Great* by Jason Evert). Then at the end of May 2021—with high recommendation from [[Fr. Dailey]]—I felt prompted to pick it up and dive in. What an adventure!
