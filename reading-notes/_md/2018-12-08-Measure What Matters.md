# [*Measure What Matters*]() by John Doerr

(New York: Penguin, 2018), 287

- OKRs = Objectives & Key Results
  - "what" and "how"
  - reviewed quarterly
  - public and transparent
  - bottom-up or sideways (50%)
  - mostly divorced from compensation
  - aggressive and aspirational
- Example OKR:
  - **Objective**: Demonstrate the 8080's superior performance as compared to the Motorola 6800
  - **Key Results**:
    - Deliver five benchmarks.
    - Develop a demo.
    - Develop sales training materials for the field force.
    - Call on three customers to prove the material works.
- Four OKR Superpowers:
  1. Focus and Commit to Priorities
  2. Align and Connect for Teamwork
  3. Track for Accountability
  4. Stretch for Amazing
- CFRs = Conversation, Feedback, and Recognition for continuous performance management
- Andy Grove taught Doerr OKRs at Intel and he has been an OKR evangelist since
