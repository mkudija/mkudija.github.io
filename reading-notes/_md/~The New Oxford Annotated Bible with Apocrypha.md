## 4 Maccabees
- Author's thesis: **devout reason is sovereign over the emotions**
- Eleazar and the seven brothers and their mother (cf. [[2 Mc-07]]) demonstrate how reason controls the emotions
- Wonderful image: "Just as pleasure and pain are two plants growing from the body and the soul, so there are many offshoots of these plants, each of which the master cultivator, reason, weeds and prunes and ties up and waters and thoroughly irrigates, and so tames the jungle of habits and emotions. For reason is the guide of the [[virtues]], but over the emotions it is sovereign." (4 Mc 1:28-30, NRSV)
- The [[Chastity]] of [[Joseph (OT)]]: "It is for this reason, certainly, that the temperate Joseph is praised, because by mental effort he overcame sexual desire. For when he was young and in his prime for intercourse, by his reason he nullified the frenzy of the passions." (4 Mc 2:2-3, cf. [[Gn-39#v7]])
- We correct those we love: "It is superior to love for one's wife, so that one rebukes her when she breaks the law. It takes precedence over love for children, so that one punishes them for misdeeds. It is sovereign over the relationship of friends, so that one rebukes friends when they act wickedly." (4 Mc 2:11-13)
- "Now when God fashioned man, he planted in him emotions and inclinations, but at the same time he enthroned the mind among the senses as a sacred governor over them all." (4 Mc 2:21-22)
- "No one of us can eradicate that kind of desire, but reason can provide a way for us not to be enslaved by desire." (4 Mc 3:2, cf [[2 Sm-23#v15]]/[[1 Chr-11#v17]] using the example of David refusing water to demonstrate this)
- [[Eleazar]]: "To transgress the law in matters either small or great is of equal seriousness, for in either case the law is equally despised" (4 Mc 5:20-21)
- "You know, O God, that though I might have saved myself, I am dying in burning torments for the sake of the law. Be merciful to your people, and let our punishment suffice for them. Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs." (4 Mc 6:27-29)
- "Such should be those who are administrators of the law, shielding it with their own blood and noble sweat in sufferings even to death." (4 Mc 7:8)
- "By your deeds you made your words of divine philosophy credible." (4 Mc 7:9)
- "But as many as attend to religion with a whole heart, these alone are able to control the passions of the flesh, since they believe that they, like our patriarchs Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, do not die to God, but live to God." (4 Mc 7:18-19)
- "[The seven brothers] opposed the tyrant with their own philosophy, and by their right reasoning nullified his tyranny." (4 Mc 8:15)
- Second brother: "Do you not think, you most savage tyrant, that you are being tortured more than I, as you see the arrogant design of your tyranny being defeated by our endurance for the sake of religion?" (4 Mc 9:30)
- Chapters 8-17 tell the story of the seven brothers who were martyred, cf. [[2 Mc-07]]
- "Brothers, let us die like brothers for the sake of the law; let us imitate the three youths in Assyria who despised the same ordeal of the furnace." (4 Mc 13:9, cf. [[Dn-03]])
- "O Israelite children, offspring of the seed of Abraham, obey this law and exercise piety in every way, knowing that devout reason is master of all emotions, not only of sufferings from within, but also of those from without." (4 Mc 18:1-2)
- 4 Mc 18:14 quotes [[Is-43#v2]]: "when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you."
