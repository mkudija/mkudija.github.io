`(New York: Oxford Paperbacks, 2008-04-17), 212`

- "The person who lives a just and holy life is one who is a sound judge of these things. He is also a person who has ordered his love, so that he does not love what it is wrong to love, or fail to love what should be loved, or love too much what should be loved less (or love too little what should be loved more), or love two things equally if one of them should be loved either less of more than the other, of love things either more or less if they should be loved equally." (1.27-28, pg 21) ^9d554d
