## Editor's Introduction

## Chapter 1: The Liberal Arts
- **The [[Trivium]]**: The three arts of language pertaining to the mind (3)
	- **Logic**: art of thinking
	- **Grammar**: art of inventing and combining symbols
	- **Rhetoric**: art of communication
- **The [[Quadrivium]]**: The four arts of quantity pertaining to matter
	- *Discrete quantity or number*
		- **Arithmetic**: theory of number
		- **Music**: application of the theory of number
	- *Continuous quantity*
		- **Geometry**: theory of space
		- **Astronomy**: application of the theory of space
- Prescriptions (9)
	- **Phonetics**: prescribes how to combine sounds so as to form spoken words correctly.
	- **Spelling**: prescribes how to combine letters so as to form written words correctly.
	- **Grammar**: prescribes how to combine words so as to form sentences correctly.
	- **Rhetoric**: prescribes how to combine sentences into paragraphs and paragraphs into a whole composition having unity, coherence, and the desired emphasis, as well as clarify, force, and beauty.
	- **Logic**: prescribes how to combine concepts into judgments and judgments into syllogisms and chains of reasoning so as to achieve truth
- Norms (10)
	- **Correctness** is the norm of phonetics, spelling, and grammar.
	- **Effectiveness** is the norm of rhetoric.
	- **Truth** is the norm of logic. Correctness in thinking is the normal means to reach truth, which his the conformity of thought with things as they areâ€”with reality.


## Chapter 2: The Nature and Function of Language
- Symbols (13)
	- **Temporary symbols**: signals adopted by a football team, the password necessary to get through military lines, school or team colors.
	- **Permanent symbols**: traffic lights, flags, a soldier's salute, a nod of affirmation, heraldry, hieroglyphics, chemical formulas, numbers.
- Essence terms (18)
	- **Essence** is what makes a being what it is.
	- **Species** is a class made up of individuals that have in common the same specific essence.
	- **Genus** is a wider class made up of two or more different species.
	- **Aggregate** is a group consisting of two or more individuals.
- Generating a concept (22)
	- **Percept**: the image created by the external senses upon encountering reality
	- **Phantasm**: the mental image created by the internal sense, primarily the imagination
	- **Concept**: the abstraction created by the intellect through recognition of the essence
- Imposition of words (39)
	- **First Imposition**: a word used to refer directly to reality.
	- **Zero Imposition**: a word used reflexively with reference to itself as a sensible sign.
	- **Second Imposition**: a word used reflexively with reference to the sensible sign and to the meaning. Grammar is the science of second imposition.
- Intention of words (40)
	- **First Intention**: a word used to refer to a reality
	- **Second Intention**: a word used reflexively to refer to itself as a term or a concept. Logic is the science of second intentions.
- Deliberate ambiguity (44)
	- **Irony**: the use of words to convey a meaning just the contrary of the one normally conveyed by the words
	- **Pun**: the use of a word simultaneously in two or more meanings
	- **Metaphor**: the use of a word or phrase to simultaneously evoke two images
- Key ideas in chapter 2 (46)
	- **Being** is either the being of the whole individual or of the essence which is common to the individuals of either a species or a genus.
	- The **phantasm** is (1) a mental image of (2) an object outside the mind (its extensional reference); from this image the intellect abstracts (3) the concept within the mind (its intensional reference).
	- A **symbol** is an arbitrary sensible sign having meaning imposed on it by convention. (A concept is not arbitrary.)
	- **Language** has a logical and a psychological dimension.
	- **Matter** and **form** constitute a composite whole.
