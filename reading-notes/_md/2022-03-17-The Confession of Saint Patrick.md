## Introduction
*by Lawrence S. Cunningham (Notre Dame)*
- This is one of Patrick's two extant works: *Confesio* and *Epistola* (Letter to Coroticus)
- St. Patrick was not the first bishop of Ireland, but his mission was one of the first to evangelize non-Christians outside the Roman Empire
- "Confession" as used by Patrick and [[St. Augustine]] in his *[[~Confessions]]* is both an *admission of sin* and an *act of faith*
- Patrick's *Confession* shares parallels with other "prison" experiences by saints: [[St. Francis of Assisi]], [[St. John of the Cross]] in his *Spiritual Canticle* (cf. the *[[2017-11-01-The Vanishing American Adult#Chapter 8 Build a Bookshelf|The Vanishing American Adult]]* talking about prison literature)
- Patrick's *Confession* is marked by its deep Trinitarian faith and sense of mission
- [[Breastplate of St. Patrick]]
- "Patrick's *Confession* is saturated with the presence of Christ who is present in the world in an almost palpable fashion." (25)
- "To be a Catholic Christian is not only a matter of adhering to a creed. It is, rather , to enter into a story that is both retold in the proclamation of the gospel and reenacted in those rituals we call sacraments." (26)

## Translator's Introduction

- "I, Patrick, a sinner..."
- "And there the Lord opened the consciousness of my unbelief...**and kept watch over me before I knew Him**" (46-47)
- [[Education]]: "strip naked my unlearnedness" (54)
- St. Patrick Church Columbus' motto: "to make known the gift of God" *notum facere donum Dei* (58)

## Part 3
_**Summary**: [[Leviticus]]: ecclesiastical authorities and status._



## Part 4
_**Summary**: [[Numbers]]: Patrick's account of his sacramental ministry._
- [[Chastity]]: "But the inimical flesh always drags toward death, that is, toward allurements to be dealt with illicitly, and I know in part why I have not lived a perfect life, just as the others also believing, but I confess to my Lord, and I do not blush for shame in His sight." (94)


## Part 5
_**Summary**: [[Deuteronomy]]: Patrick's preparation for death._
