## Preface 
>Just as **progressive Catholics** are constantly revisiting the Council so as to tell again the story of their liberation from the ancient pharaoh of the older Catholicism, so it is, alas, incumbent on **orthodox Catholics** to revisit the texts in a better frame of mind than that of their liberal rivals. This is less often done, and it is too important a task to be left to **traditionalist Catholics** who can find in the Council nothing more than a damnable *débâcle*. (7)


## Chapter 1: On Interpreting the Council
- Bologna School: interpret as an "event" where the texts take a minor place  (10)
	- Relies upon "Reception Theory" that judges a council by its reception. But validity is one thing and reception is another: *reception does not confer validity* (11)
- "The only proper way to approach the conciliar texts is to take them as they stand."  Extratextual considerations should be limited to the process of devising and revising the texts, because this shows how those who composed and voted for the texts understood them and wanted them to be understood. (12)
- *[[Hermeneutic of continuity]]*: The entire corpus of texts must be seen ultimately from the standpoint of Tradition as a whole. "The perennial Tradition of the church has to be the principal vantage point in assessing these texts." (13)
- Henri de Lavalette "early emphasized the very diverse level of authority within the corpus of [Vatican II] texts." (13) Look for phrases like "This holy synod teaches", or "We believe" (15)
- The great majority of the Council's statements are not *fides divina et Catholica* but *fides ecclesiastica*, "ecclesiastical faith", or "official Magisterium when formal revelation is not at stake. Rejection of statements made at this level would not be heresy, though it would estrange one fro mthe mainstream thinking of the contemporary church." (16)

## Chapter 7: [[2022-12-03-Dei Verbum|Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (DV)]]
_**Summary**: _
- Vatican I's *Dei Filius* emphasized faith and reason 
- Curial draft *De fontibus revelationis* (On the Sources of Revelation) focused on Tradition-Scripture relationship and the inerrancy and historicity of the Bible (114)
	- Controversial reversed vote resulted in personal intervention of Pope John XXIII and moved the document to a Mixed Commission (117), and Paul VI made the draft a priority for the third session (119), and again intervened to delay and push the text back in a more traditional direction (120)
- Chapter 1: Divine Revelation Itself 
	- The aim of revelation is to make men sharers in divine life 
	- Divine *deeds* corroborate the truth of divine *words*
	- God is the author of the twofold order of revelation in nature and history 
- (Chapters 2, 3, 5 deal with the three hot-button issues of the document: tradition, historicity, and inerrancy)
- Chapter 2: Transmission of Divine Revelation 
	- Two positions on Tradition and Scripture include: 
		- Minimizing Position: *All truths of revelation are locatable in Scripture in some manner* (by reference to Tradition).
		- Maximizing Position: *Not all truths of revelation are locatable in Scripture in some manner* (there are some divinely revealed truths belonging to the deposit of faith which are only found in Tradition).
		- Both positions regard Tradition as a necessary aid in the reading of Scripture.
		- The Minimizing position is motivated by ecumenism (less offensive to Protestants), but elsewhere the council assumes the Maximizing position.
- Chapter 3: Inspiration and Interpretation of Scripture 
	- Penultimate version of the document had the phrase *veritas salutaris* ("saving truth"), limiting inerrancy to truths of faith and morals pertinent to salvation
	- Final version: "that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the sacred Scriptures"
	- Nichols commentary on this passage: "The background of this particular change makes it plain that interpreters who find here an affirmation of the partial inerrancy of Scripture are mistaken, though the claim that for Vatican II only biblical texts that bear directly on salvation are deemed inerrant is nonetheless often heard. Taken by itself the text is indeed open to this interpretation. But it is not open to that interpretation when the history of the text is taken into account." (124-125)
	- This affirmation of inerrancy could lead to fundamentalism, so DV also underlines the importance of ascertaining what type of truth claims are involved (understanding author, genre, language, and the wider context of the Bible and Tradition), drawn from *[[~Divino Afflante Spiritu|Divino Afflante Spiritu]]*. 
- Chapter 4: Old Testament 
	- Here the original draft is most intact
- Chapter 5: New Testament 
	- Affirms the apostolic origins and historicity of the Gospels
	- They are not neutral historical accounts, but they do recount the plain and honest truth 
- Chapter 6: Scripture in the Life of the Church 
	- Encourage scripture study at all levels, but not in isolation from Tradition (also study the Fathers and Liturgies, "the most important monuments or embodiments in which Tradition is found")
	- [[Raymond E. Brown]] took this seriously in his early work, and his [[~The Gospel According to John (I-XII)|two volume commentary on the Gospel of John]]  is "deservedly a modern classic."
	- "But on the whole the creation of a body of Catholic biblical scholarship which integrates with the historical method the study of patristics is one of the unachieved aims of Vatican Council II." (127)
