## Introduction 
- "SEALs operate best in small units, and a key to their success has always been teamwork." (5)
- Kim Erskin in Grenada: "Each thought he was going to die in that open field. Even Navy SEALs know fear, and here, we're talking about paralyzing, oh-please-God-no, pee-in-your-pants fear. They were scared, but they were also very well trained. In life-and-death situations, mortal fear can cause men to freeze—-totally immobilize them. Often, only the confidence instilled by repetition and drill can get them moving. Often, there is a fine line between preparation and bravery." (8)
- "The account of Kim Erskin and the SEALs at the radio tower on Grenada is extreme, but perhaps not unusual. Intelligence about enemy troop strength and opposition forces is usually accurate. The radios usually work. But what if they don't? Then, it's all about the men in the fight. Are they true warriors? In the face of overwhelming odds, do they have the training and the will to fight and win?" (11)
- "[SEAL training] is a sorting process that finds- young men who would rather die than quit, then instills them with a relentless desire to fight and win as a team." (12)

## Chapter 1: The Beginning
- "When one man in the class screws up, sometimes the whole class pays the tab. Sometimes a single boat crew pays or just the class leaders. But someone always pays." (18)
- BUD/S: 2-week indoctrination, First Phase (conditioning), Second Phase (diving), Third Phase (weapons and tactics)
- BUD/S Screening Test: 
	- 500 yard swim using breast- or sidestroke in 12:30
	- 42 pushups in 2 min 
	- 50 situps in 2 min 
	- 6 dead hang pull ups 
	- 1.5 mi run in 11:30 wearing boots and long pants 
- Instructor Reno: "You stay in the box and I'll help you. you get outside the box and I'll hammer you." (24)
- "The students run six miles each day just to eat. BUD/S trainees live on the run adn are always cold and wet." (26)
- "The secret to underwater swimming is going deep early. The trainees learn that if they swim along the bottom in deeper water, the increased partial pressure of oxygen in their lungs will allow them to hold their breath longer and swim farther." (28-29)
- PT: Focus is abs (sit-ups, leg levers, flutter kicks) and arms (pushups)
- "Your best defense against the pain and abuse is your personal motivation and your class spirit." (33)
- "The guys in the teams are a brotherhood. You'll be closer to them than you ever were to your friends in high school or college. You'll live with them on deployment and some of you may even die with them in combat. But never, ever forget your family. Family comes before teammates. Most of us will grow old and die in bed, and the only people who will be there to help us die will be our family. Put your family first. I want you to never forget that." (44)
- "I think BUD/S training may be like childbirth; the pain is quickly pushed aside by the joy of having it behind you." (48)


## Chapter 2: First Phase
- "Secured to a stanchion just outside the First Phase office is a famous BUD/S institution—the bell. Tradition calls for a student who quits in First PHase to ring the bell three timesa ND place his helment on the grinder." (55)
- Those that failed the 32 minute time for a 4-mile run on the beach are sent into the water: 
	- "Over the years, the BUD/S medical department has developed an immersion table based on water temperature and activity. Hypothermia is no stranger at BUD/S training." (56)
	- "Those guys are winners; you guys are losers. You better start taking this training seriously of you're not going to be around here much longer. They paid the price up front and now they et a little time off. You didn't. You failed. And now you're paying a bigger price." (57)
- Advice from CO Captain Ed Bowen (71)
	- Don't give into the pressure of the moment. Finish the day.
	- Take it one day at a time. 
- Six keys to getting through Hell Week: a positive attitude, teamwork, guts, a never-quit mentality, a belief in yourself, and focus (96)
- "Your reputation in the teams will begin by how you handle yourself when you're cold, wet, and tired." (96)


## Chapter 3: The Week (Hell Week)
- 
- "It pays to be a winner—always." (153)
- "All right, guys, I want you to take a minute and think about this. No matter what you do in the future, remember this moment; you men just finished Hell Week. Few men are able to do what you just did. Whether you stay in the Navy or get out and run a latte stand—whatever—never, never forget this moment or what you achieved here this week. When things get tough in lite, this will be your benchmark. Others will quit, but you won't. Because if you can do this, you can do anything, right?" (156)
- "Each man finds a brown T-shirt with his name on it. It's only a cheap military T-shirt of a particular color, but it is everything—they're brown shirts." (157)


## Chapter 4: Beyond the Week
- "Hell Week is a curious and unique event. I'm not sure I understand it much better now, having just watched it, than when I went through my Hell Wek some thirty years ago. I do know that it changes a man forever. Future challenges and many of life's triumphs are now calibrated by this experience." (162)
- Hell Week used to be the first week of training: "train-the-best, discard-the-rest" philosophy (163)
- Officers train with their men: "The idea that officers have to train and suffer with their men, especially suffering on this scale, is unique in American military service. Today, officer trainees, like SEAL platoon officers, have to lead while under pressure, and have to suffer the same hardships as their men. SEAL work is a harsh, physically demanding business. If an officer is to lead from the front, he needs to be, at a minimum, as physically capable as the men he expects to follow him." (163)
- History of the SEAL teams (163-165)
- "One thing is clear: the instructors still have great power and influence. The skill with which they mete out punishment and approval, to individuals and to the class, has a tremendous bearing on the outcome. A large percentage of Class 228, like those classes before them, are led through or driven from training by their BUD/S instructors. It's a challenging time, both physically and emotionally, for trainees as well as staff. What's at stake for the individual trainee is the personal goal of a young life. For the instructors, it's the future composition of the SEAL teams and the character of this warrior culture." (167)
- "Naval duty, both aboard ship and on shore, has a way of growing boys into men—helping them to sort out what they really want in life." (168)
- "Very few trainees see this business for what it really is—a long and painful road to a warrior culture, one with ongoing physical demands and hardship as a way of life. They don't fully understand the SEAL saying "Training is never over" until they're in it. Some also questioned their suitability for this warrior calling, which entails the taking of human life, and they realized this profession was not for them. I once asked a highly successful attorney friend of mine why he was so good at his job. "Most guys with law degrees just want to be lawyers," he told me. "They don't really, and I mean really, want to practice law." I think it's the same with BUD/S trainees. A lot of them would like to call themselves SEALs, but perhaps not so many of them are prepared to do the work of Navy SEALs." (168-169)
