## Introduction 
- "SEALs operate best in small units, and a key to their success has always been teamwork." (5)
- Kim Erskin in Grenada: "Each thought he was going to die in that open field. Even Navy SEALs know fear, and here, we're talking about paralyzing, oh-please-God-no, pee-in-your-pants fear. They were scared, but they were also very well trained. In life-and-death situations, mortal fear can cause men to freezeâ€”-totally immobilize them. Often, only the confidence instilled by repetition and drill can get them moving. Often, there is a fine line between preparation and bravery." (8)
- "The account of Kim Erskin and the SEALs at the radio tower on Grenada is extreme, but perhaps not unusual. Intelligence about enemy troop strength and opposition forces is usually accurate. The radios usually work. But what if they don't? Then, it's all about the men in the fight. Are they true warriors? In the face of overwhelming odds, do they have the training and the will to fight and win?" (11)
- "[SEAL training] is a sorting process that finds- young men who would rather die than quit, then instills them with a relentless desire to fight and win as a team." (12)

## Chapter 1: The Beginning
_**Summary**: _
- "When one man in the class screws up, sometimes the whole class pays the tab. Sometimes a single boat crew pays or just the class leaders. But someone always pays." (18)
- BUD/S: 2-week indoctrination, First Phase (conditioning), Second Phase (diving), Third Phase (weapons and tactics)
- BUD/S Screening Test: 
	- 500 yard swim using breast- or sidestroke in 12:30
	- 42 pushups in 2 min 
	- 50 situps in 2 min 
	- 6 dead hang pull ups 
	- 1.5 mi run in 11:30 wearing boots and long pants 
- Instructor Reno: "You stay in the box and I'll help you. you get outside the box and I'll hammer you." (24)
- "The students run six miles each day just to eat. BUD/S trainees live on the run adn are always cold and wet." (26)
- "The secret to underwater swimming is going deep early. The trainees learn that if they swim along the bottom in deeper water, the increased partial pressure of oxygen in their lungs will allow them to hold their breath longer and swim farther." (28-29)
- PT: Focus is abs (sit-ups, leg levers, flutter kicks) and arms (pushups)
- "Your best defense against the pain and abuse is your personal motivation and your class spirit." (33)
- "The guys in the teams are a brotherhood. You'll be closer to them than you ever were to your friends in high school or college. You'll live with them on deployment and some of you may even die with them in combat. But never, ever forget your family. Family comes before teammates. Most of us will grow old and die in bed, and the only people who will be there to help us die will be our family. Put your family first. I want you to never forget that." (44)
- "I think BUD/S training may be like childbirth; the pain is quickly pushed aside by the joy of having it behind you." (48)
