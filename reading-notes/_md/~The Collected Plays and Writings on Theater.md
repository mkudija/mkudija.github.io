# The Collected Plays

## Job



## Jeremiah



## Our God's Brother



## The Jeweler's Shop



## Radiation of Fatherhood



## Reflections on [[Fatherhood]] *[1964]*
- About Adam, Loneliness, Fatherhood, Sonship (and as of 2022-09-20 reading John Paul II is still difficult for me)
- "That I continually evade Your Fatherhood and gravitate toward my loneliness so that You must reveal yourself in an external vacuum?" (366)
- "After a long time I came to understand that You do not want me to be a father if I am not also a son. The son is wholly Yours." (367)
- "To absorb the radiation of fatherhood means not only to become a father but, much more, to become a child (become a son)." (368)
- "The more I am a father, the more I become a child." (368, cf. [[Mt-18#v3]])
- "And everything else will then turn out to be unimportant and inessential, except for this: father, child, and love." (368)
