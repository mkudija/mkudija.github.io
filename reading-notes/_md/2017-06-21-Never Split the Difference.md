# *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss

* Chapter 1 - 
    * Ask open ended ("calibrated") questions: buys you time and gives them the sense of control
    * Negotiation can be overly rational and formulaic: we need to keep in mind that we are people and have emotions 
        * Use Kahneman's understanding of our two types of thinking
    * Use tactical empathy to gain access to the mind of the other
* Chapter 2 - Mirroring 
    * Your most powerful tool in verbal communication is your voice
    * Mirroring (isopraxism), is imitation to establish rapport and lead to trust - we trust what is alike us
        * Repeat the last 3 words (or one important word) they said
    * Mirroring allows you to disagree without being disagreeable
    * The intention behind mirrors should always be "please help me understand"
    * Lessons from this chapter
        * A great negotiator uses his skills to reveal the surprises he is certain to find
        * Use assumptions as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them vigorously
        * A negotiation isn't a battle, it's an opportunity to discover information
        * Make your sole focus the other person and what they have to say
        * slow it down
        * put a smile on your face
    * Three voices of negotiators
        * Late night DJ: downward inflection calm and slow to make a point with authority without awakening defensiveness
        * Positive/playful voice: should be default, relax and smile while talking
        * Direct/assertive voice: use rarely
* Chapter 3 - 
    * Empathy: the ability to recognize and vocalize the other person's perspective. You don't have to agree with them, just imagine yourself in their shoes
    * Tactical empathy: understanding feelings and emotions-and what is behind them-so you can increase your influence
    * Labeling: validating someone's emotion by naming it
        * use "It sounds like..." rather than "I'm hearing that...": "I" gets people's guard up
        * After labeling, wait in silence
        * Labeling diffuses negative emotions and reinforces positive emotions
    * Accusation audit: list everything negative they could say about your to "take the sting out"
* Chapter 4 - No
    * Allow yourself and the other to say "no", it helps you feel comfortable and somewhat in control. No can mean:
        * I'm not ready
        * I'm uncomfortable
        * I need more information
        * ...etc.
    * No is a starting point
    * There are 3 kinds of yes: Counterfeit, confirmation, and commitment
    * Our primal urges: to feel safe/secure, and to feel in control
* Chapter 5
    * "That's right" is better than yes
    * "You're right" is dangerous
* Chapter 6
    * Compromise rarely leads to great results (think one brown shoe and one black shoe)
    * It is important to know each other's deadlines, but they aren't fixed in stone
    * "if you approach the negotiation thinking the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong"
    * The most powerful word in negotiation is "fair": 
        * "we just want what's fair"
        * "we have given you a fair offer"
        * "I want you to feel like you're being treated fairly at all times, so please stop me if you feel otherwise"
    * Anchor their emotions
        * anchor their emotions and expectations low and then play on loss aversion
    * let the other guy go first, usually
        * let them anchor and adjust, especially when you don't have all the information
    * establish a range
        * understand that if you offer a range they will come in low
    * pivot to non-monetary
    * when you talk numbers, use odd numbers
        * an odd number ($115,500) sounds more exact, calculated, and immovable than a round $110,000
    * make a surprise gift - which they will feel obligated to repay
    * SALARY NEGOTIATION
        * be pleasantly persistent on non-salary terms: builds the right environment for discussion and can lead to higher salary if they can't meet those desires
        * define success for your position and metrics for your next raise
        * "what does it take to be successful here": once they give you guidance they have a stake in if you succeed and you have gained a mentor
* Chapter 7
    * asking calibrated questions (asking for help) is the most powerful way to suspend unbelief, allows them to focus on solving the problem and gives them the illusion of control
    * instead of saying what you "need", describe what you are looking for and ask for suggestions
    * ask: "How am I supposed to do that?"
    * calibrated questions
        * be open ended, start with "what", "how"
    * calibrated questions require self-control 
        * bit your tongue
* Chapter 8
    * "yes" is nothing without "how"
    * signs that they're not on board with you:
        * "you're right" instead of "all right"
        * "I'll try" means "I plan to fail"
    * identify and motivate the players behind the table 
    * Dealing with difficult/aggressive negotiators:
        * 7-38-55: % contribution of message, tone, and body language, respectively
        * Rule of 3: get 3 yeses in the same conversation to confirm you are on the same page
        * Use your name in your speech as a form of "forced empathy"
        * use a multi step empathetic no
* Chapter 9
    * any response that is not an outright rejection means you have the edge
    * archetypes of negotiating style:
        * Accommodate
        * Assertive
        * Analyst
    * Ackerman bargaining system (for buying):
        * Set your target (goal)
        * Set you first offer at 65% target
        * Calculate 3 raises of decreasing increments (85%, 95%, 100%)
        * Use empathy and "no" to get the other side to counter before decreasing offer
        * Use precise, non-round number for your final offer
        * On final number, throw in a non-monetary item they don't care about to show you're at your limit
* Chapter 10
    * Black Swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on past experience (unknown-unknown)
    * never make a threat, but use labels to make the point:
        * "It seems like you value that I've always paid on time"
        * "It seems like you don't care what position you're leaving me in"
    * know your opponent's worldview or "religion"
    * People trust familiarity: build rapport
    * Express passion for their goals
    * Give a reason for your requests 
    * Don't accept that they are "crazy": search to understand why 
        * If they have bad information, they will make bad decisions 
        * Weird behavior might indicate constraints that they haven't revealed
        * They may have other interests 
    * Get face time
    * Observe the unguarded moments before and after the actual negotiation 
    * If it doesn't make sense, there are cents ($) to be made 
    * 3 types of leverage 
        * Positive (give them what they want)
        * Negative (hurt them)
        * Normative (using their norms to bring them around) 
* Prepare negotiation sheet
    * When the pressure is on, we fall to our highest level of preparation
    * The goal
        * Think though best/worst case scenarios but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case
        * Don't focus too much on BATNA since it can be too low and become your goal
        * Never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better
        * Write your goal down, discuss it with someone else, and carry the written goal into the negotiation 
    * Summary
        * Write out a couple sentences to understand facts that led to negotiation 
        * Your counterpart must be able to respond with "that's right"
    * Labels/Accusation Audit
        * Prepare 3-5 labels to perform and accusation audit
        * Make a list of accusations they might bring 
        * Then turn that list into labels and role play
        * Examples
            * It seems like x is valuable to you
            * It seems like you don't like x
            * It seems like you value x
            * It seems like x makes it easier
            * It seems like you're reluctant to x
    * Calibrated Questions
        * Prepare 3-5 calibrated questions 
        * Example "how" and "what" questions:
            * What are we trying to accomplish?
            * How is that worthwhile?
            * What's the core issue here?
            * How does that affect things?
            * What's the biggest challenge you face?
            * How does that fit in with the objective?
        * Behind the Table killers (committee) 
            * How does this affect the rest of the team?
            * How on board are the people not on this call?
            * What does your boss see as the main challenge?
        * Find deal-killing issues 
            * What are we up against here? 
            * What's the biggest challenge you face? 
            * What happens if you do nothing? 
    * Noncash Offers
        * Prepare a list of noncash items possessed by your counterpart that would be valuable 
        * What could they give us that would get us to do this for free?
