## Preface
- "In this book I seek to provide that evidence, in particular evidence for the Resurrection whichâ€”if it occurredâ€”would be the divine signature on the teaching of Jesus and the teaching of the Church which he founded." (v)

## Chapter 11: Rival Theories of what Happened 

## Chapter 12: The Significance of the Resurrection


# Part IV: Conclusion

## Chapter 13: The Balance of Probability 
- Evidence-based support for the resurrection of Jesus requires a belief in the kind of the God who would intervene in human history (203)
- "If the background evidence leaves it not too improbable that there is a God likely to act in the ways discussed, then the total evidence makes it very probable that Jesus was God Incarnate who rose from the dead." (203)

## Appendix: Formalizing the Argument
**Logical [[Probability]]**
- Formalize his argument numerically using the axiomatic form by Kolmogorov (204)
- Three types of probability: 
	- **Physical Probability**: possible future event based on past events (relative to time)
	- **Statistical Probability**: proportion in an actual or hypothetical class 
	- we care about: Inductive or Epistemic or **Logical Probability**: the measure of the extent to which one proposition makes another likely to be true 
- **Notation**
	- $P(p|q)$: probability of $p$, given $q$
	- $N$: of logical necessity
	- $\lor$: or
	- $\iff$: if and only if
	- $N(p \iff q)$: $p$ and $q$ are logically equivalent
- Axioms (205-206):
	1.  $P(q|r) \ge 0$
		- *The probability of any proposition given any other proposition cannot be less than zero*
	2. If $N(r \rightarrow q), P(q|r) = 1$
		- *If $r$ entails $q$, then given $r$, $q$ is certainly true*
	3. If $N \sim (p \space \& \space q \space \& \space r)$ and $\sim N(\sim r)$ , $P(p \lor q | r) = P(p|r) + P(q|r)$
		- *The probability that $p$ or $q$ (or both) is true, given $r$ is the sum of {the probability that $p$ is true given $r$} plus {the probability that $q$ is true given $r$}, if $r$ is a logical possibility and if, given $r$, $p$ and $q$ cannot both be true*
	4. $P(p \space \& \space q | r) = P(p|q \space \& \space r) P(q|r)$
		- *The probability that both $p$ and $q$ are true, given $r$, is the probability that one of them ($q$) is true given $r$, multiplied by the probability that, given $r$ and also $q$, the other will be true*
	5. If $N(p \iff q)$, $P(r|p) = P(r|q)$
		- *If $p$ and $q$ are logically equivalent, the probability of some proposition given the one is the same as the probability of that proposition given the other*
- [[Bayes's Theorem]] (206)
	- $e$: observed evidence, data 
	- $k$: background evidence 
	- $h$: hypothesis under investigation
	- $P(h|e \space \& \space k) = \frac{P(e|h \space \& \space k) P(h|k)}{P(e|k)}$
	- Ignore the background evidence ($k$) in questions of metaphysics (it is mere tautology or repetition)
	- $P(h|e \space \& \space k)$ is the **posterior probability**, which is high if:
		- $P(e|h \space \& \space k)$ (the posterior probability of $e$) is high
			- Extent to which you expect to find $e$ if $h$ is true
		- $P(h|k)$ (the prior probability of $h$) is high, and 
		- $P(e|k)$ (the prior probability of $e$) is low (i.e., for tautological $k$, is a measure of how likely $e$ is to occur if we do not assume any particular theory to be true)
- "Scientific examples show us that simplicity is more important than scope for determining prior probability" (207) 

**The Logical Probability of Theism**
- For $h$ there is a God, he has argued elsewhere that $P(e|h \space \& \space k)$ is as probable as not (if there is a God with infinite power and knowledge and freedom you would expect to find the things we do in $e$), and $P(e|k)$ is comparatively low (you would not expect to find these things without a God)
