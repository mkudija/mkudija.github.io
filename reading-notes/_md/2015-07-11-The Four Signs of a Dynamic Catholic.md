* Introduction
    * Work advice:
        * don’t schedule meetings/phone calls before 11 a.m. every day
        * take 20 minutes each Sunday afternoon to plan what projects to work on each morning that week
* Prayer
    * when you are spiritually healthy, nothing bothers you
    * one of the key indicators of spiritual health is gratitude
    * he keeps a CD in his car: Come to the Quiet by John Michael Talbot
    * passion and purpose are the by products of personal clarity (53)
        * clarity emerges from silence
    * every family needs a prayerful giant
* Study
    * the best thing you can do for anyone else is to grow in holiness = become a better version of yourself (79)
* Generosity
    * GENEROSITY CHALLENGE: 
        * calculate how much I gave in the last year as a % of my income
        * increase by 1% each year until I reach 10% (or further if feasible)
* Evangelization
    * The Church doesn’t tell us what we can/cannot do. “The Church simply stands in every place and time pointing out the path toward the best way to live.” (158)
    * people are won through Truth, Beauty, and Goodness
