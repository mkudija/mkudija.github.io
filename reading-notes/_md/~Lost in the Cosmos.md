`(New York: Macmillan, 1983), 272`

- "Thus, the rightful legatee of the greatest of fortunes, the cultural heritage of the entire Western World, its art, science, technology, literature, philosophy, religion, becomes a second-class consumer of these wares and as such disenfranchises itself and sits in the ashes like Cinderella yielding up ownership of its own dwelling to the true princes of the age, the experts...There is an expert for everything that ails me." (77-78)
- "The wonder to the scientist is not that God made the world but that works of God can e understood in terms of a mechanism without giving God a second thought." (90)
