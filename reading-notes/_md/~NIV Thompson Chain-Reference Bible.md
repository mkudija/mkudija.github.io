	- Three principles: 
		- Meaning of words determined by the use in the language at that time (using computational linguistics to choose "humanity", "man", and "mankind" but not "he"/"his")
		- Meaning is found not in individual words but larger clusters 
		- Words have a spectrum of meaning (not translate every Hebrew word occurrence with the same English word)
	- Textual basis: Masoretic Text
