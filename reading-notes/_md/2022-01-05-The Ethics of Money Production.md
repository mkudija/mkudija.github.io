write notes:
- We need re-train ourselves about what money even *is*: tangible commodity value. We can perform all daily activities without ever touching money (or even cash which is fiat paper). Work, numbers show up on the screen, buy things and numbers get smaller and things show up at the door.
- private vs fiat inflation (5)

[Mises notes](https://mises.org/library/ethics-money-production):

>By "money production," the author is speaking not in the colloquial sense of the phrase "making money," but rather the actual production of money as a commodity in the whole economic life. The choice of the money we use in exchange is not something that needs to be established and fixed by government.

>In fact, his thesis is that a government monopoly on money production and management has no ethical or economic grounding at all. Legal tender laws, bailout guarantees, tax-backed deposit insurance, and the entire apparatus that sustains national monetary systems, has been wholly unjustified. Money, he argues, should be a privately produced good like any other, such as clothing or food.

>In arguing this way, he is disputing centuries of assumptions about money for which an argument is rarely offered. People just assume that government or central banks operating under government control should manage money. Hulsmann explores monetary thought from the ancient world through the Middle Ages to modern times to show that the monopolists are wrong. There is a strong case in both economic and ethical terms for the idea that money production should be wholly private.

>In his normative analysis, the author depends heavily on the monetary writings of 14th-century Bishop Nicole Oresme, whose monetary writings have been overlooked even by historians of economic thought.

### Bitcoin
- his objections to bitcoin
	- A money commodity "must be desired for its nonmonetary services (for its own sake)"
	- Do contracts/other attributes of the blockchain give bitcoin intrinsic (though not physical) value?

## Preface
_**Summary**: This book is an exposition of monetary theory that applies the tradition of philosophical realism to the analysis of money and banking, with special emphasis on the scholastic tradition of [[Nicholas Oresme]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], as well as [[Austrian School]] as a champion of the realist tradition and free-market policies._
- [[Murray Rothbard]] credits Thomism with a critical development in ethics by pointing to the power of reason (even before faith in God)
- [[Joseph A. Schumpeter]] credits the scholastics for founding the science of economics

## Introduction
_**Summary**: Money is everywhere in our lives but is not usually given a proper moral treatment, at least partially driven by the conflict of interest among economists who are remunerated in some form by the process of fiat inflation. Hülsmann provides an extensive bibliography in the scholastic and Austrian traditions and demonstrates fundamental compatibility between Austrian economics and Christian morals._
- The problem: money is everywhere in our lives but not given a proper moral treatment (in traditional economics, Catholic social teaching, etc.)
- Money production is a problem of justice because of the legal institutions that control it, and the inflation they cause is a great evil
- The introduction (and its copious footnotes) provide extensive additional reading in the [[Austrian School]]
	- [[Nicholas Oresme]]'s *Treatise on the Alteration of Money* is a continual reference point in this text and foundational to the moral treatment of money
	- Economists in the [[Austrian School]] including: [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] (integrated the theory of money and banking within the overall theory of subjective value and pioneered macroeconomic analysis in the realist tradition), [[Murray Rothbard]] (apex of Austrian theory, integration of ethics)
	- Scholastics and Austrians agree on the *integration* of economics with larger social phenomena
	- Thomas Woods argues in *The Church and the Market* that Austrian economics and Christian morals are fully compatible (this is an exception as many contemporary Christian writers agree with pro-inflation doctrines)

 
# Part 1: The Natural Production of Money

## Chapter 1: Monies
_**Summary**: _
- Money is a partial solution to the challenges of barter
- The **[[Law of Comparative Advantage|Law of Association]]** is the fundamental law of production: joint production yields greater return than isolated production, thus always drawing humans together
- Commodities with intrinsic value became money for indirect exchange, allowing the division of labor to grow
- **Money:** a medium of exchange that is *generally accepted* in society. This acceptance comes by virtue of objective physical characteristics and has historically been dominated by the precious metals for their *scarcity, durability, divisibility, distinct look and sound, homogeneity through space and time, malleability, and beauty*
- A money commodity "must be desired for its nonmonetary services (for its own sake)"
-
