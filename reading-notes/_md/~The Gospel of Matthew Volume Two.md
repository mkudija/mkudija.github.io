**The Great Refusal**
[[Mt-19#v22]]
"This man was so shackled to his possessions that nothing less than surgical excision of them would suffice. If a man looks on his possession as given to him for nothing but his own comfort and convenience, they are a chain which must be broken; if he looks on his possessions as a means to helping others, they are his crown." (215-216)
