- "We have to **prepare** to have freedom. We have to do the **work** to then do the job. We have to prepare for the job so we can be **free** to do the work." (137)
- "We are all made for every moment we encounter. Whether the moment makes us or we make the moment. Whether we are helpless in it or on top of it, the predator or the prey. We are made for that moment." (141)
