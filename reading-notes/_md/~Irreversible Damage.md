## Introduction
- "One protagonist has led them all, notorious for magnifying and spreading her own psychic pain: the adolescent girl...Today's diagnostic craze isn't demonic possessionâ€”it's 'gender dysphoria.'" (xix)
- Before 2012 there was no scientific literature on gender dysphoria in girls 11-21, but they are now the majority (xxi)
- **"America has become fertile ground for this mass enthusiasm for reasons that have everything to do with our cultural frailty: parents are undermined; experts are over-relied upon; dissenters in science and medicine are intimidated; free speech truckles under renewed attack; government healthcare laws harbor hidden consequences; and an intersectional era has arisen in which the desire to escape a dominant identity encourages individuals to take cover in victim groups."** (xxiii)
- The teenage girl transgender craze that is the subject of this book is different from the civil rights of "traditional" transgender activism: it originates not in gender dysphoria but from the internet and fills needs of acceptance and transgression
