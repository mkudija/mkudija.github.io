## Introduction
- [[Inflation]] is a psychological phenomenon based on expectations: money supply can lead to inflation but inflation requires a catalyst (4)
	- "[[Inflation]] is always and everywhere a psychological phenomenon. When citizens lose confidence in a form of money, velocity takes off." (8)
- *[[2021-03-05-The Deficit Myth]]*: "Contrary to the leanings of modern monetary theorists like Professor [[Stephanie Kelton]], the Fed does not have an unlimited capacity to monetize debt. The constraint is not legal, but psychological. There is an invisible confidence boundary on the size of the Fed's balance sheet. The Fed cannot cross this boundary without destroying confidence in the central bank and the dollar...A central bank will find out the hard way instantaneously when they cross it." (11)
- [[Gerald Ford]]'s two great contributions were 1) the [[Helsinki Accords]] which recognized human right and freedom in Soviet States, setting the stage for [[John Paul II]]'s activities in Poland, among others; and 2) the legalization of the owning of gold: "Freedom to own gold means freedom from inflation, freedom from banks, and freedom from digital surveillance and hacking...Americans can create a personal gold standard thanks to the emancipation from fiat money afforded by [[Gerald Ford]]." (15-17) 


## Chapter 1: Scattergoods
_**Summary**: Investors should prepare for a more mercantilist (less globalist and free trade) world in which trade surpluses and gold accumulation are ends in themselves. Acquire gold and silver, invest in gold and silver mining companies, and invest in companies with a strong domestic market (Boeing, SolarWorld, Mission Solar, Nucor, U.S. Steel, GM)._



## Chapter 2: Putting Out Fire with Gasoline
_**Summary**: Prepare for sustained slow growth by 1) reduce exposure to high-growth tech stocks, i.e. FAANG, 2) allocate part of your portfolio to sectors that perform well in low-growth/deflationary environments such as utilities, 10-yr US Treasuries, high-quality municipal bonds, and 3) increase your cash reserves to protect against deflation and give you optionality. This slow-growth portfolio provides steady yields, hedges deflation, avoids losses on highfliers, and offers a chance to bottom fish in the next recession or crash._



## Chapter 3: Find the Cost of Freedom
_**Summary**: Don't blindly follow the choices provided to you by the financial industry, and reduce your exposure to products promoted by them. Instead consider income-producing real estate, natural resources, museum quality collectibles, and other asset classes not available in 401(k)s. Don't max out your 401(k) but rather save some to invest elsewhere._



## Chapter 4: The Alpha Trap
_**Summary**: Diversify away from exchange traded products. **Allocate 30% to cash** to reduce portfolio volatility and give you the ability to shop for bargains in the aftermath of a crash. **Allocate 10% to physical gold** allocation to ensure against inflation or account freezes and exchange closures. **Allocate 10% to private equity and venture capital** in firms where you know the founders and operators, providing upside and diversification away from market trends._



## Chapter 5: Free Money
_**Summary**: Construct a barbell portfolio to protect against both inflation and deflation. Inflation protection consists of gold, silver, land, and other hard assets. Deflation protection consists of 10-yr Treasuries, utility stocks, and technology companies that continually reduce costs. Cash is in the middle and allows you to shift either direction when needed._



## Chapter 6: The Mar-a-Lago Accord
_**Summary**: Investible assets exclude home equity, business equity, and other illiquid or intangible assets, and you should allocate 10% to physical gold in safe, non-bank storage. Using an example portfolio of 10% gold, 30% cash, and 60% equities. In scenario 1, if gold declines 20% your overall portfolio decreases 2% and is offset by equity performance. In scenario 2, if equities decline 85% and gold gains 650% (predicted $10k/oz gold price),  you lose 50% on stock and gain 65% on gold and your wealth is preserved or increased, and the cash._

- Rickard's $10k/oz gold forecast: 
	- US dollar vulnerable to collapse from printing and debt
	- This might result in a return to a gold standard
	- Major countries have M1 ≈ $24T and 33k tons of gold
	- Gold standard requires ~40% gold backing to maintain confidence

```
$24,000,000,000,000 M1 money
33,000 tons gold
32,150.7 oz gold/ton [link](https://sdbullion.com/blog/how-many-ounces-in-a-ton-of-gold)
```

```
24000000000000 [$M1] * 0.4 [%] / (33000 [tons] * 32150.7 [oz/ton]) = 9,048 [$/oz]
```


## Chapter 7: Godzilla
_**Summary**: Allocate wealth to alternative assets, especially physical gold._



## Chapter 8: Aftermath
_**Summary**: The best time to buy gold is now before the next crisis hits._


## Conclusion

>How did you go bankrupt?
>Two ways. Gradually and then suddenly.
>–*The Sun Also Rises* by [[Ernest Hemmingway]]

- *The Mandibles* by Lionel Shriver or *Our Town* by Thornton Wilder is a more realistic view of what happens after a financial collapse: hyperinflation, barter economy, mass unemployment, rather than something more post-apocalyptic like *[[2021-07-27-The Road]]*
	- "Those who assume such scenarios won't happen again put too much faith in central banks and too little in the study of history." (293)
	- The novel demonstrates the importance of rural community and practical skills for surviving a collapse
	- "A farm is more important than a college degree"...wealth consists of tangible assets and practical skills..."hard assets and hard work are the only stores of value" (295)
