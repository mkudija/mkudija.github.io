# Notes
### Chapter 1
- He’s not a religious believer but he goes to church, feels deep spiritual peace in cathedrals  
  
### Chapter 2
- 950-1250 the weather was better than usual  
- Jean Gimbel: *The Cathedral Builders*  
  
### Chapter 3
- Victor Hugo  
  
### Chapter 4
- architect and restoration of Notre Dame  
  
### Chapter 5
- Charles de Gauls processes to ND  
  
### Chapter 6
- a cathedral is so rich that at first is overwhelms us (I remember having a distaste for Gothic architecture initially)  
- medieval illustrations of the Tower of Babel fife is information about how cathedrals were built  
- *The Cathedral Builders* was one of the books that inspired him to write *[[2015-12-31-The Pillars of the Earth]]*. Turns out Jean Gimpel lived on his street in London and signed on as a consultant for the book and became his friend.  
- lists a number of authors inspired by cathedrals: Hugo is the greatest  
- cathedrals were never the mastermind of a single person, like the producer of a movie: “for me the cathedral is about what people can achieve when they work together” (and for a higher purpose)  
- like a space launch: took a whole society, spurred technology, brought economic benefits...and yet when you add up all the practical reasons they’re not quite enough to explain why we did it: has the spiritual element, it was done for the glory of God  
 - medieval builders made the unseen parts just as beautiful since they were seen by God
