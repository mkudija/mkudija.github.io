### Inferno Canto 1 - *Prologue*

> Midway in the journey of our life
> I came to myself in a dark wood,
> for the straight way was lost.
>–*Inferno* Canto 1. 1-3

- the first line echoes [[Is-38#v10]]: ![[Is-38#v10]]
- "half" his life is 35 or half of 3 score and ten cf. [[Ps-90#v10]]: ![[Ps-90#v10]]
- journey of "our" life: his journey is ours as well

> And then a she-wolf who, all hide and bones, 
> seemed charged with all the appetites
> that have made many live in wretchedness
>–*Inferno* Canto 1. 49-51

<br><br>
> 'Have mercy on me, whatever you are,'
>–*Inferno* Canto 1. 65

- echoes [[Ps-51#v3]] ([[Ps-51–LOTH]])

### Inferno Canto 2 - *Prologue*
> We should fear those things alone
> that have the power to harm.
>–*Inferno* Canto 2. 88-89 (Beatrice)

### Inferno Canto 3 - *The Gates of Hell*
> Abandon all hope, you who enter here.

> And he to me: 'This miserable state is borne
> by the wretched souls of those who lived
> without disgrace yet without praise.
>–*Inferno* Canto 3. 34-35

- This is the "anti-inferno" or vestibule of hell for the neutrals who never took a side, cf. [[Rv-03#v15]]. But mustn't we ultimately embrace God or reject Him?

> They have no hope of death,
> and their blind life is so abject
> that they are envious of every other lot.
>–*Inferno* Canto 3. 46-48

- 52-57: Dante's ***contrapasso***: punishment in his hell is the application of the opposite of the sin
- 58-60: "the great refusal" perhaps refers to Pope Celestine V who abdicated the papacy in 1294 (followed by Benedict XVI in 2013) and was later canonized

### Inferno Canto 4 - *Limbo*
Limbo for Dante includes the virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants (compare with [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s limbo including the Hebrew saints and unbaptized infants), who are aware of the better life that is denied them:
> They did not sin. Though they have merit,
> that is not enough, for they were unbaptized,
> denied the gateway to the faith that you profess.
> <br><br><br>
> And if they lived before the Christians lived,
> they did not worship God aright.
> –*Inferno* Canto 4. 34-38

<br><br>
> When I understood, great sadness seized my heart,
> for then I knew that being of great worth
> were here suspended in this Limbo.
> –*Inferno* Canto 4. 43-45

First reference to Christ:

> I was new to this condition when I saw
> a mighty one descend, crowned, with a sign of victory.
> –*Inferno* Canto 4. 53-54

### Inferno Canto 5 - *Lust*
We can either confess our sins to a priest (and obtain absolution), or to Minos to assign our place in hell:
> There stands Minos, snarling, terrible.
> He examines each offender at the entrance,
> judges and dispatches as he encoils himself.
> <br>
> I mean that when the ill-begotten soul
> stands there before him it confesses all,
> and that accomplished judge of sins
> <br>
> decides what place in Hell is fit for it,
> then coils his tail around himself to count
> how many circles down the soul must go.
> –*Inferno* Canto 5. 4-12


Echoes [[Mt-07#v13]]:
> Don't let the easy entrance fool you.
> –*Inferno* Canto 5. 20

Dante's definition of lust is making "reason subject to desire". Hollander's notes reference the lust of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s *The Waste Land* 222-248
> they who make reason subject to desire.
> –*Inferno* Canto 5.39

There is no intercession in hell:
> if the King of the universe were our friend
> we would pray that he might give you peace
> –*Inferno* Canto 5. 91-92

This is the sad analogy to [[Jb-01#v21]] (Hollander's notes also reference *Consolation of Philosophy* by Boëtius: "among fortune's many adversities the most unhappy kind is once to have been happy"):
> And she said to me: 'There is no greater sorrow
> than to recall our time of joy
> in wretchedness—and this your teacher knows.
> –*Inferno* Canto 5. 121-123


### Inferno Canto 6 - *Gluttony*
> For the pernicious fault of gluttony,
> as you can see, I'm prostrate in this rain.
> –*Inferno* Canto 6. 53-54

<br><br>
> Pride, envy, and avarice are the sparks
> that have set the hearts of all on fire.
> –*Inferno* Canto 6. 74-75

### Inferno Canto 7 - *Avarice & Prodigality*
> And why do our sins so waste us?
> –*Inferno* Canto 7. 21

<br><br>
> No you see, my son, what brief mockery
> Fortune makes of goods we trust her with,
> for which the race of men embroil themselves.
> <br>
> All the gold that lies beneath the moon, 
> or ever did, could never give a moment's rest
> to any of these wearies souls.
> –*Inferno* Canto 7. 61-66

The three kinds of anger for Aristotle and Thomas: choleric (comes and departs quickly), bitter (not released easily), and difficult (hostile and directed against those it should not be):
> And I, my gaze transfixed, could see
> people with angry faces in that bog,
> naked, their bodies smeared with mud.
> <br>
> They struck each other with their hands,
> their heads, their chests and feet,
> and tore each other with their teeth.
> –*Inferno* Canto 7. 109-114


### Inferno Canto 8 - *Anger & Sullenness*
> Reader, how could I not lose heart
> at the sound of these accursèd words?
> I thought I would never make it back.
> –*Inferno* Canto 8. 94-96

### Inferno Canto 9 - *Heresy*
The Furies represent the three main categories of sin: *incontinence*, *violence*, and *fraud*.

> O you who have sound intellects,
> consider the teaching that is hidden
> behind the veil of these strange verses.
> –*Inferno* Canto 9. 61-63

<br><br>
> Why do you kick against that will
> which never can be severed from its purpose?
> –*Inferno* Canto 9. 94-95

<br><br>
> For here the graves were strewn with flames
> that made them glow with heat
> hotter than iron is before it's worked.
> <br>
> All their covers were propped open and from them
> issued such dire lamentation it was clear
> it came from wretches in despair and pain.
> –*Inferno* Canto 9. 118-123

Heresy is a sin of the will due to the obstinacy of error (cf. *[[2021-08-12-Summa Theologiae]]*, II-II, q. 5, a. 3).

### Inferno Canto 10 - *Epicurians*

Epicurus: virtue was to be practiced because it led to happiness (the [[Stoic]]s held that virtue should be cultivated for its own sake. To Dante, [[Epicurianism]] is "the pleasure principle", or "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" (cf [[1 Cor-15#v32]]).

> Here Epicurus and all his followers,
>  who hold the soul dies with the body,
>  have their burial place.
> –*Inferno* Canto 10. 13-15

<br><br>
>  We see, like those with faulty vision,
>  things at a distance, he replied. That much,
>  for us, the mighty Ruler's light still shines.
> –*Inferno* Canto 10. 100-102

### Inferno Canto 11 - *Order of Hell*
> Every evil deed despised in Heaven
> has as its end injustice. Each such end
> harms someone else through either force or fraud.
> <br>
> But since the vice of fraud is man's alone,
> it more displeases God, and thus the fraudulent
> are lower down, assailed by greater pain
> –*Inferno* Canto 11. 22-27

[[2021-10-16 Question on Usury]]:
> That human toil, as far as it is able,
> follows nature, as the pupil does his master,
> so that it is God's grandchild, as it were.
> <br>
> By toil and nature, if you remember Genesis,
> near the beginning, it is man's lot
> to earn his bread and prosper.
> <br>
> The usurer, who takes another path,
> scorns nature in herself and in her follower,
> and elsewhere sets his hopes.
> –*Inferno* Canto 11. 103-111


### Inferno Canto 12 - *Violence*
[[Progress & History]]: "This 'circular' theory of history is intrinsically opposed to the Christian view, in which Christ's establishment of love is as a universal principle redeemed history once and for all." (230)

> The river of blood that scalds
> those who by violence do injury to others.
> <br>
> O blind covetousness, insensate wrath,
> which in this brief life goad us on and then,
> in the eternal, steep us in such misery!
> –*Inferno* Canto 12. 47-51

<br><br>
> Around the moat they go in thousands,
> shooting arrows at any soul that rises
> higher from the blood than guilt allows.
> –*Inferno* Canto 12. 73-75

### Inferno Canto 13 - *Suicide*
> Such pity fills my heart
> –*Inferno* Canto 13. 84

St. Jerome's comment on [[Ps-08]]: "Judas offended God more greatly by hanging himself than by betraying Him." (253)

### Inferno Canto 14 - *Blasphemy*
> And here the dreadful work of justice is revealed.
> –*Inferno* Canto 14. 6

*Contrapasso*:
> What I was alive, I am in death.
> –*Inferno* Canto 14. 51

<br><br>
> Because your pride remains unquenched
> you suffer greater punishment.
> In your own anger lies your agony,
> a fitting torment for your rage.
> –*Inferno* Canto 14. 63-66

### Inferno Canto 15

[video](https://youtu.be/kc-uhYxR1a0?t=283): Primo Levi's [*Survival In Auschwitz*](https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Auschwitz-Primo-Levi/dp/0684826801) tells of how he recited lines from the *Inferno* to remember his humanity in Auschwitz

> By following your star
> you cannot fail to reach a glorious port
> –*Inferno* Canto 15. 55-56

[[Writing]]:
> You taught me how man makes himself immortal.
> –*Inferno* Canto 15. 85


### Inferno Canto 16
> The three...looked at one another
> as men do when they face the truth
> –*Inferno* Canto 16. 76-78

<br><br>
> Ah, how cautious we should be with those
> who do not see our actions only,
> but with their wisdom peer into our thoughts!
> –*Inferno* Canto 16. 118-120

<br><br>
> To a truth that bears the face of falsehood
> a man should seal his lips if he is able,
> for it might shame him, through no fault of his

> no one waited for a second or a third.
> –*Inferno* Canto 18. 35-39

### Inferno Canto 19 - *Simoniacs*
> O Simon Magus, o wretches of his band,
> greedy for gold and silver,
> who prostitute the things of God.
> –*Inferno* Canto 19. 1-3

<br><br>
> O Supreme Wisdom, what great art you show
> in Heaven, on earth, and in the evil world,
> and what true justice does your power dispense!
> –*Inferno* Canto 19. 10-12

<br><br>
> Along the sides and bottom I could see
> the livid stone was pierced with holes,
> all round and of a single size.
> ...
> From the mouth of each stuck out 
> a sinner's feet and legs up to the thighs
> while all the rest stayed in the hole.
> <br>

> –*Inferno* Canto 19. 13-25

<br><br>

> –*Inferno* Canto 19. 90-93

cf. [[Lk-16#v13]], [[Mt-06#v24]]:

"The word *contrapasso* is generally understood to be based on an Aristotelian term in its Latin translation, *contrapassum*, used in the same sense that the biblical concept of retribution, expressed in the Latin *lex talionis* (the taking of an eye for an eye, etc.), is understood to have." (529)
