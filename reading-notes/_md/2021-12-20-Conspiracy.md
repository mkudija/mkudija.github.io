## Chapter 10 - the power of secrets
- “History is one long exercise in the triumph of secrets”; but transparency carries in the modern world the weight of moral imperative

## Chapter 15
- "A [[Leadership|leader]] may be defeated but should never be surprised"

## Chapter 16
- “Thiel had proven that ‘nothing you can do about it’ is just what people who don’t want to do anything about it say to make themselves feel better about their inaction.”


## Chapter 18

## Conclusion
- “If you want to have a different world, it’s on you to make it so”...
“In a time when computers are replacing many basic human functions, it will eventually come to be that audaciousness, vision, courage, creativity, a sense of justice: these will be the only tasks left to us.”
