- Pope Boniface VIII declared 1300 a Holy Year, and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] describes this in *[[2021-09-16-The Inferno|The Inferno]]*, Canto XVIII
- "The once hunted, hounded, despised, tortured, and martyred Christians eventually and peacefully conquered Rome and continue to reign here in the person of the Vicar of Christ. There is scarcely a brick in Rome that does not attest to that fact. It is my purpose to show the pilgrim how to find our Christian heritage in Rome, not only in the basilicas and churches, but virtually everywhere." (5)
- Nine apostles are believed to be buried in Rome (8):
	- Peter, Jude, Simon the Danaanite in St. Peter's 
	- Paul in St. Paul's Outside the Walls 
	- St. Bartholomew in his church 
	- Matthias in the crypt below Santa Maria Maggiore
	- Philip and James the Less in Santi Apostoli
	- Andrew in his church 
- The four pillars of St. Peter's supporting the dome contain the relics of Veronica's veil, the lance that pierced Christ's side, the head of St. Andrew, and a piece of the True Cross. (36)
- San Carlo on Via delle Quattro was built to the dimensions of merely one palister of St. Peter's (36)
