*an excerpt of this published in [[The Classical Teacher - Late Summer 2022]]*

>What I would offer, then, are the six definitive canons of what I shall
describe in the broadest possible sense as the **Christian Platonic tradition**. Let me offer them in a list, and then turn to their explication. The West proposes:
>1. that **man is an intellectual animal**;
>2. that his nature is founded on a prior or **foundational intelligibility in the world** and that he is intellectually and erotically oriented toward transcendent knowledge of it;
>3. that this dual orientation proceeds by way of **reason** toward an intellectual vision perceptive of **Beauty** Itself, which is the splendor of **truth**;
>4. that the **world is itself ordered by and to Beauty**;
>5. that human dignity specifically consists in our capacity to perceive and **contemplate that splendorous order**, and, thus, the most excellent form of human life is that which is given over to such contemplation; and finally,
>6. that this **contemplation realizes itself in what we may call happiness or salvation**, and it is characterized by an activity that resembles passivity, that is to say, not simply the absence of motion but a fullness of activity that is called peace and freedom.
