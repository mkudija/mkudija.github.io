## Introduction


#### [[Jn-21|John 21:1-6]]: The Church's Toil in the Twilight of the Resurrection 
- "[[St. Gregory the Great|Gregory]] remarks that there are two kinds of work. One absorbs the mind, and hinders our spiritual concerns, as tax collecting. No one should return to such work, even to provide food. So we do not read that Matthew returned to his tax collecting post. There is another kind of work which can be done without sin and without absorbing the mind, such as fishing and similar things. And it was not a sin for Peter to return to this kind of work after his conversion." (338-339, cf. *Forty Gospel Homilies*, 24.1)
	- → *Is this a model for work in an age of AI, where work that "absorbs the mind" is both less valuable and distracting from our final end?* cf. [[2025-11-29-Pints 553 with Joe Heschmeyer]]
