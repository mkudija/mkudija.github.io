## Introduction
*[[2022-03-21-Mon]]: read introduction and notes*
- [[Freedom]]: "The Western dream of autonomy and choice without limits is, in fact, a prison" (4)
	- [[St. Maximilian Kolbe]]'s "sacrifice represented a strange yet perfect form of [[Freedom]]...he climbed the very summit of human freedom by binding himself to the Cross" (7)
	- Our version of [[Freedom]] (from) sprang from the [[Enlightenment]], to liberate man from tradition (8)
- "A radically assimilated immigrant isn't supposed to complain about his freedom. Yet as I grow into my faith and my role as a father, I tremble over the prospect of my son's growing up in an order that doesn't erect any barriers against individual appetites." (12)
- The whole of the [[Psalms]] can be summed up as finding joyous liberation in binding oneself to the Mosaic law, which the psalmist treasures as a guide to the inner structure of the cosmos. Jesus's entire teaching, meanwhile, might be encapsulated in his Gethsemane prayer, recorded in all three of the Synoptics: "Not what I will, but what you will" ([[Mk-14#v36]]; cf. [[Mt-26#v39]]; [[Lk-22#v42]]).
- This work is asks twelve timeless questions that challenge our contemporary dogma through the lens of one thinker
- [[Phrases to use]]: Respecting tradition is "having one foot in the past" (21)
