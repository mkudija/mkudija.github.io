- Pére Jacques' prayer (84-85) (short): **"O God, I wish to be fully what I am."**
- Pére Jacques' prayer (84-85) (long): "O God, I wish to be just what I am for as long as you so will; I am aware of an evil strain deep within me. That strain spawn egotism, infidelity and hostility, leading to moodiness, laziness, and self-indulgence. I wish to be fully what I am. For, I know that you are all powerful and could change me in an instant. yet, at the same time, you are infinitely loving and offer me whatever is for my best. I have total trust in you. you are all powerful and you love me! Amen."
