[[Confession]], contrition, penance/satisfaction:

> seemed to me porphyry, as flaming red

Peter denied him three times (cf [[Mt-26#v69]]):
>Devoutly I cast myself down at his holy feet.
>I begged him for mercy and to let me enter,
>but first, three times, I smote my breast.
>With the point of his sword he traced seven P's
>upon my forehead, then said: 'Once you are inside,
>see that you wash away these wounds.'
>–*Purgatorio* Canto 9. 109-114

Dante says a lot that is consistent with the Church's teaching, but we can't always take him at face value: Hollander notes that "we should not be surprised to find that this poet remakes any text or any doctrine to his own liking and for his own reasons" (201).

### Purgatorio Canto 10
> One would have sworn he was saying: 'Ave,'
> for she as well was pictured there
> who turned the key to love on high.
> –*Purgatorio* Canto 10. 40-42

From lunch with [[Dan Gibson]] [[2022-01-11-Tue]], David serves as a forerunner of Jesus who identifies himself with humility rather than pride(cf [[2 Sm-06#v14]]-[[2 Sm-06#v22]]):
> There the humble psalmist leaped in dance
> before the blessèd vessel with his robe hitched up—
> and was at once both more and less than king.
> –*Purgatorio* Canto 10. 64-66


### Purgatorio Canto 11
Verse [[Our Father]]:
> Our Father, who are in Heaven,
> circumscribed only by the greater love
> you have for your first works on high,
> 
> praised be your name and power
> by every creature, as is fitting
> to render thanks for your sweet breath.
> 
> May the peace of your kingdom come to us,
> for we cannot attain it of ourselves
> if it come not, for all our striving.
> 
> As your angels make sacrifice to you
> of their free wills, singing *hosanna*,
> so let men make an offering of theirs.
> 
> Give us this day the daily manna
> without which he who labors to advance goes backward through this bitter wilderness.
> 
> And, as we forgive those who have wronged us,
> do you forgive us in your loving kindness—
> measure us not as we deserve.
> 
> Do not put to proof our powers,
> which yield so lightly to the ancient foe,
> but deliver us from him who tempts them.

<br><br>
