### Introduction 
- The best way to teach philosophy is by a story...the best way to learn philosophy is through history 
- The best introduction to Philosophy is the *[[~Great Dialogues of Plato|Dialogues of Plato]]*
- This book gives much more space to the "Big Nine" most influential philosophers of all time: [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[St. Augustine|Augustine]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], [[Descartes]], [[Hume]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]]

### A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy 
- "Philosophy begins in wonder and ends in wisdom."
- The four divisions of philosophy are:
	- Metaphysics - what is real?
	- Philosophical anthropology - what am I?
	- Epistemology - How can I know?
	- Ethics - What should I do? 
- Everyone has a philosophy 

### Do-It-Yourself Course in Philosophy 

## Introduction to Ancient Philosophy

# The Sages

### Solomon
*What is the meaning of life? Nothing. All is vanity.*
- [[Ecclesiastes]] is a work of philosophy asking: *What is the meaning of life?*
	- *Nothing (nihilism). All is vanity.*
- This question (and answer) is included in the Bible as part of the rabbinic confrontational teaching method (similar to the Socratic method)

### Zoroaster
*Monotheistic dualism between good and evil*
- [[Nietzsche]] wrote *[[~Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]* to satirize Zoroaster's moral and religious dualism 

### Shankara ★
*The Hindu Thomas Aquinas*
- *Vedas*: mythical and poetical
- *Upanishads*: philosophical—reality is absolutely single: all things are appearances of one reality 
	- *Brahman* is the impersonal, eternal, divine Mind, transcending all dualities
- *Bhagavad-Gita*: practical and personal 

### Gotma the Buddha ★
*The man who woke up: enlightenment through the extinguishing of desire*
- Middle way between self-indulgence and self-mortification 
- Four Noble Truths:
	- To live is to suffer 
	- The cause of suffering is desire 
	- The way to the extinction of suffering is the extinction of desire 
	- The way to extinguish desire is the Noble Eightfold Path
- Where [[Aristotle]] discovered the essential logical form of all theoretical thinking, Buddha did the same for practical thinking 

### Confucius 
*The Socrates and Aristotle of China*
- Man is not born either good or evil, but able to be good by being trained and taught rightly
- Virtue ethics 

### Lao Tzu 
*Tao—the way*
- Suppleness rather than rigidity is the ideal
- The *Tao The Ching* is the most translated book in the world after the Bible, and has striking similarities to the Sermon on the Mount

### Mo Tzu 
*Universal love*

### Jesus ★★★
*He is the end and object of all philosophy*


# The Greeks (and a few Romans)
- "Almost everything of lasting value in Western civilization comes from either the Jews or the Greeks."

### Thales of Miletus 
*The first to ask: What is everything? (Water)*
- Thales took the first step in philosophy.

### Anaximander
*What is everything? The infinite.*

### Anaximenes
*What is everything? Air.*

### Pythagoras 
*All things are numbers.*
- Discovered that nature obeyed mathematical laws and math is the very "language of nature"
- Believed the cosmos was a giant musical instrument designed to play the "music of the heavenly spheres"

### Heraclitus ★
*Everything changes.*
- Everything is made of fire, and the cosmos is at war 
- All things change, and there is a *Logos* (law) of change 
- This *Logos* also governs all human affairs 
- "One's metaphysics always determines one's ethics. Practice always presupposes theory." (58)

### Xenophanes
*First philosophical theologian*
- He reasoned his way to a monotheism against the polytheism of his peers 
- Kreeft: Read with a dictionary at hand: "Minds are only as big as their ideas, and ideas live only in idea-houses, which are words." (59)

### Parmenides ★
*Only Being is; nonbeing cannot be.*
- He is the opposite of Heraclitus. Instead of *everything flows*, *nothing flows*
- The contrast between Heraclitus and Parmenides shaped the whole history of Western philosophy. 
- He follows reason rather than the senses: pure rationalism with no concession to empiricism

### Zeno of Elea 
*Pure logic, but reduced to ridiculousness*
- Zeno's paradoxes are *reductio ad absurdum* arguments; they are logical absurdities where logic disproves the testimony of the senses 

### Empedocles
*Earth, air, fire, water*
- Reality composed of four elements: earth, air, fire, water 
- "Who is more pitiable: the modern person who can no longer see the whole, or the premodern person who has not yet clearly distinguished the parts?" (71)

### Anaxagoras 
*Explanation by Mind, not just matter*

### Democritus ★

### Lucretius 

### Protagoras and the Sophists ★

### Gorgias the Sophist 

### [[Socrates]] ★★ 

### [[Plato]] ★★

### [[Aristotle]] 

### Pyrrho and Skepticism

### Diogenes the Cynic and Cynicism

### Epicurus and Epicureanism (Hedonism) ★

### Epictetus and Stoicism ★

### [[Seneca]] 

### [[Marcus Aurelius]]

### [[Cicero]]

### Plotinus and Neoplatonism ★
