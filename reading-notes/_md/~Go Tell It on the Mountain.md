Becca got this for me for my birthday. I can't say I really enjoyed it—it is tough. It illustrates how we need to be authentic (and not hypocritical) in our faith, and how we need to be humble. I love how it is so full of biblical allusions.

- so much 
- love all the biblical allusions, just saturated with scripture 
- can't imagine leaving your kid at home while you work (Charlie for 1 hr call)

- "It might look easy to just sit up there in the pulpit night after night, year in year out, but let them remember the awful responsibility placed on his shoulders by Almighty God—let them remember that God would ask an account of him one day for every soul in his flock, let them remember this when they thought he was hard. Let them remember that the word was hard, that the way of holiness was a hard way." (9)
- The weight of the responsibility of a [[Fatherhood|father]] to image the Heavenly Father to his children: "His father was God's minister, the ambassador of the King of Heaven, and John could not bow before the throne of grace without first kneeling to his father." (14)
- " I'm *sure* this ain't no way to be. Ain't got no right to have a houseful of children if you don't know how to treat them." (18)
- "There's a whole lot of things you don't understand, but don't you fret. The Lord'll reveal to you in His own good time everything He wants you to know. You put your faith in the Lord, Johnny, and He'll be sure to bring you out. Everything works together for good for them that love the Lord." (26, cf. [[Rom-08#v28]])
- Worried not about his brother, but his father's reaction: " Roy got stabbed with a knife. Whatever this meant, it was sure that his father would be at his worst tonight. John walked slowly into the living-room... his father's face was terrible in anger, but now there was more than anger in it... he hated John because John was not lying on the sofa where Roy lay." (36-37)
- Gabriel is an example of how a father can destroy his children's faith (not dissimilar to *[[2024-01-23-Purple Hibiscus|Purple Hibiscus]]*): "'What these children hear ain't going to do them near as much harm as what they *see*'. 'What they *see*,' his father muttered, 'its a poor man trying to serve the Lord. *That's* my life.' 'Then I guarantee *you*,' she said, 'that they going to do their best to keep it from being *their* life. *You* mark my words.'" (39)
- "'I know it looks hard,' said Elijah, 'from the outside, especially when you young. But you believe me, boy, you can't find no greater joy than you find in the service of the Lord... When the Lord saves you, He burns out all that old Adam, He gives you a new mind and a new heart, and then you don't find no pleasure in the world, you get all your joy in walking and talking with Jesus every day.'" (49)
- Pentecostal theology: 
	- Eucharist: "He thought of a First Sunday, a Communion Sunday not long ago when the saints, dressed all in white, ate flat, unsalted Jewish bread, which was the body of the Lord, and drank red grape juice, which was His blood." (51)
	- Justification: ==add note==
