- Education is cultural transmission
- Classical education goes back to the well-walked path of the tried and proven 
- *[[Classical Education]] is the authoritative, traditional, and enduring form of education, begun by the Greeks and Romans, developed through history, and now being renewed and recovered in the 21st century.*
- Education is the making of a man, not the training of a man to do things 
- Horace Mann and John Dewey are fathers of progressive education and "learn by doing" 
- Learn [[Latin]]: enhance English vocabulary, understand grammar, gateway to Romance languages 
- [[Trivium]]: 
	1. Break it down to fundamentals and master these 
	2. Study the relationships of these fundamentals 
	3. Write and speak clearly on what has been learned 

>Parents at classical schools do not assume that education is the school's responsibility. They understand that the school is assisting them to *fulfill* their responsibility.

>Classical education turns out to be, at bottom, the love of our children to whom we give the best we have received.

- [ ] The Revised Edition ofÂ _An Introduction to Classical Education_ will be released in May 2023. ðŸ“… 2023-05-01
