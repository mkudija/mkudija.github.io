## Chapter 1: Brothers and Sistersâ€”Past and Present



## Chapter 2: Not Till the Bad Feelings Come Out
- Siblings need to have their feelings about each other acknowledged
- Children need to have their hurtful actions stopped and shown how to discharge angry feelings acceptably
- Refrain from attacking (and giving attention to) the attacker



## Chapter 3: The Perils of Comparisons
- Resist the urge to compare. Instead describe what you *see* or *feel*
- Avoid both favorable and unfavorable comparisons



## Chapter 4: Equal is Less
- Children don't need to be treated equally. They need to be treated uniquely.
- Instead of worrying about giving equal amounts, focus on each child's individual needs
- Instead of claiming equal love, show children how they're loved uniquely
- Equal time can feel like less, give time in terms of need



## Chapter 5: Siblings in Roles
- Let no one lock a child into a role.
- Don't give your attention to the aggressor, attend to the injured party instead.
- Instead of the parent treating the child as a "bully", help him see that he's capable of being civil.
- When the child sees himself as a bully, help him see his capacity for kindness.
- Instead of the parent treating the child as a "victim", show him how to stand up for himself.
- No more problem child: instead of focusing on children's disabilities, focus on their abilities. Children need acceptance of their frustration, appreciation for what they have accomplished (however imperfect), and help in focusing on solutions.



## Chapter 6: When the Kids Fight
- Level I: Normal bickering:
	- Ignore it.
	- Tell yourself the children are having an important experience in conflict resolution.
- Level II: Heating up:
	- Acknowledge their anger.
	- Reflect each child's point of view.
	- Describe the problem with respect.
	- Express confidence in the children's ability to find their own solution.
	- Leave the room.
- Level III: Possibly dangerous:
	- Inquire if real or play fight.
	- Affirm: play fighting by mutual consent only.
	- You are being too rough and need to find another activity.
- Level IV: Dangerous:
	- Describe what you see.
	- Separate the children.
- Resolving a difficult conflict:
	- Call a meeting and explain the purpose
	- Explain the ground rules (no interruption)
	- Write down each child's feelings and concerns
	- Allow time for rebuttal
	- Invite everyone to suggest as many solutions as possible
	- Decide on the solutions you can live with
- How t ogive support to the child who asks for it without taking sides:
	- State each child's side
	- State the value or rule
	- Leave the doorway open for the possibility of negotiation
	- Leave



## Chapter 7: Making Peace with the Past
