# Volume 1: Our Oriental Heritage
## Preface
- I think I first heard about this series in an [email from David Perell](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/the+story+of+civilization/FMfcgzGkXdJCwGBVddwKdBFNmhvHgXWL) on 2021-06-07
- I purchased volumes 1-10 from the UA library on 2021-06-16 for $20, and had to at least read the preface:
- >It may be of some use to those upon whom the passion for philosophy has laid the compulsion to try to see things whole, to pursue perspective, unity and understanding through history in time, as well as to seek them through science in space. (vii)
- >Like philosophy, such a venture has no rational excuse...but let us hope that, like philosophy, it will always lure some rash spirits into its fatal depths (viii)
- >The theme of the twentieth century seems destined to be an all-embracing conflict between the East and the West (viii-ix)
- >I shall proceed as rapidly as time and circumstance will permit, hoping that a few of my contemporaries will care to grow old with me while learning, and that **these volumes may help some of our children to understand and enjoy the infinite riches of their inheritance**.
