# *Rediscovering Catholicism* by Matthew Kelly

- "'What is the most I can do?' For this is the question of the lover" (26).
- "Freedom without discipline is impossible" (28).
- The description Kelly gives of early Christian communities, which he contrasts with the many current Catholic communities he believes are unhealthy, make me think of the Catholic community at Notre Dame, giving me hope for that community (39).
- "We become what we celebrate" (51).
- "Every honest work wan be transformed into prayer" (59).
- "The surest signs of holiness are an insatiable desire to improve oneself and an unquenchable concern for unholy people" (66).
- "The truth is, virtue is ultimately attractive...There is nothing more attractive than holiness" (67).
- "The purpose of education and extracurricular activities is to provide opportunities for our children to develop discipline.  Once discipline is learned, it can be applied to any area of life.  Those who develop this discipline go off in search of excellence and live richer, more abundant lives.  Those who do not find this grounding in discipline do many things, but none well.  God has placed you here for a purpose, but without discipline, you will never discover that purpose" (85).
- "First discipline, then genius" (86).
- "The goal of the Christian life is holiness" (86).
- "Those who refuse to study history must content themselves to make mistakes that have been made before" (91).
- "For the man who knows where he is going, the whole world will get out of his way" (123).
- "The defining quality of a true friendship is when the other person encourages you to be all you can be, challenges you to become the-best-version-of-yourself, and vice versa" (134).
- Everyday, focus on each of the four aspects of your person (physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual) and choose one goal you can accomplish to become a better person in that area. 136
- "Great men and women want to know their weaknesses" (160).
- "Excellence belongs to the humble" (174).
- "Until you have learned to see yourself in every person in the Scriptures, you have not read the Bible" (215).
- "Uncertainty is a spiritual gift designed to help you grow" (217).
- Piety in our modern, academic world, and how it can be viewed as "superstitious" or uneducated. 255
- "Simplicity is the key to perfection" (255).
