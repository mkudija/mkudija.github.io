>In 1995, Father Michael White was invited to organize the Pope's visit to Baltimore on behalf of the archdiocese. Prior to the Holy Father's arrival, the chief organizer for papal pilgrimages, Father Roberto Tucci, SJ, came to Maryland to scout out the venues and make the necessary arrangements for John Paul's trip. When he arrived at the archbishop's residence, he noticed that one of the doors in the hallway the Pope would pass through opened into a chapel with the Blessed Sacrament. He instructed Father White, "Keep that door closed so he doesn't know there's a chapel in there." Upon the Pope's arrival, the door was closed, and John Paul took some time to eat and rest at the residence. When it was time to leave, he walked down the hall, which was lined with doors leading into various rooms, passed by the door of the chapel, then suddenly stopped. He looked back at the door, then looked over at Father Tucci, and without saying a word, wagged his finger at him and shook his head. Father White recalled:
>
>He's never been in this place before, never set eyes on the place, and there was nothing about the door that distinguished it in any way as a chapel. It was just one more door in a corridor of doors. But he turned right back around, he opened that door up, and he went into the chapel and he prayed.

>According to Father White, the Holy Father remained in prayer long enough to "do some damage" to the schedule, then left the residence to head to his appointment.
