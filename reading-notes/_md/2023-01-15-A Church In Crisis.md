thoughts: 
- Repetitive, Argument not well organized  
- All correct, but Can undermine your faith of not established. That’s why I started with fulfillment before this. And I will return again and again to fulfillment, not to this  
- It’s more than a full time job just to know what the church teaches and study the Bible, yet alone know all the things wrong with it. Don’t bite off more than you can chew  
- Shows me how lucky I am to have faithful priests and bishop
- this book is a jumping off point to so many books and articles to read 


<div class="success"> <p><strong>Summary: </strong>The Church is in crisis (as usual), and renewal comes through individual turning away from sin and toward God (as usual).</p></div> 

<div class="info"> <p><strong>Thesis: </strong>The Church is experiencing a crisis across many fronts—especially a pervasive attitude of universalism and relativism that minimizes culpability for sin, the backlack from the sexual revolution leading to apostasy as the Church accommodates itself to the world, and disordered priorities that deny the Gospel in favor of more attractive secular causes—all of which supported recently by what is at best a lack of clarity or at worst a studied ambiguity from Rome. The path forward starts with individual repentance and renewal of our participation in the prophetic mission of Jesus, set aflame by the Holy Spirit.</p></div>

## Topical Notes
*Because the book has so many references and overlapping themes, I grouped some notes by topic rather than by chapter.*

### [[Pope Francis]]
- *[[2013-12-02-Evangelii Gaudium|Evangelii Gaudium]]* [[bib]]: "really good" despite being silent on the eternal consequences of unrepented serious sin 
- He is the legitimately elected success of St. Peter and deserves the respect due a pope 
- "But he clearly says and does things that seem to contradict or put into question other admirable things he has said and done." (18)
- "The net effect of this is that a rather intense polarization has occurred in the Church." (18)
- "The undeniable fact is that ambiguity and confusion often is the result, an ambiguity and confusion that he seems very reluctant to dispel." (24)
- "This ambiguity almost seems to be a hallmark of Pope Francis' approach to issues and unfortunately only permits confusion and division to increase." (35)

### *[[~Amoris Laetitia|Amoris Laetitia]]*
- 

### [[Catholic Sexual Abuse Crisis]]
- [ ] #read [What Went Wrong?](https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=5915) by [[Fr. Paul Mankowski, S.J.]] (446 cf 37)
- [ ] #read [Canon Law on Sexual Abuse through the Ages](https://www.catholicsforrenewal.org/Documents%202015/CANON%20LAW%20ON%20CHILD%20SEXUAL%20ABUSE%20THROUGH%20THE%20AGES%20SUMMARY%204_1.pdf) by Kieran Tapsell (446 cf 37)

### Key People 
*Ralph Martin names many 20th century and contemporary figures as examples of either faithful shepherds or dissenters. A partial list includes:*

**Faithful**
- [[John Paul II]] and [[Joseph Ratzinger|Benedict XVI]] for addressing the crisis of truth in their pontificates (6) 
- [[Cardinal Gerhard Müller]]: 
	- [ ] #read published [Manifesto of Faith](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/column/53977/manifesto-of-faith) (26)
- "Men of substance who love the Church and are deeply concerned enough to speak out: Cardinals Willem Eijk, Carlo Caffarra, Joachim Meisner, Raymond Burke, Robert Sarah, Paul Josef Cordes, Walter Brandmüller, Josph Zen (29)
- [[George Weigel]] (36)

**Dissenters**
- Fr. Charles Curran: dissenter from *[[~Humanae Vitae|Humanae Vitae]]* (8)
- Cardinal Walter Kasper: Synods on the Family and *[[~Amoris Laetitia|Amoris Laetitia]]* (8, 28) 
- Cardinal Antonio Tagle: Pope Francis' choice successor (8)
- Cardinal Godfried Danneels: "Sant Gallen mafia" (9)
- [[Fr. James Martin, SJ]]: (23, 47)

## Introduction 
*[A Crisis of Truth (PDF) | Renewal Ministries](https://www.renewalministries.net/shop/product/a_crisis_of_truth_pdf)*
- Ralph Martin wrote *[[~A Crisis of Truth|A Crisis of Truth]]* [[bib]] in 1982
- The leadership of [[John Paul II]] and [[Joseph Ratzinger|Benedict XVI]] addressed many of the concerns he raised in that book, but many of these have arisen anew recently. This book treats many of the same topics in light of their current manifestation. 
- What is at stake is the proper interpretation of [[Vatican II]], along the lines either of the *hermeneutic of rupture*, or the authentic *hermeneutic of continuity* [with the Tradition]
- Despite this crisis, the Catholic Church is the Church that Christ founded, and remains the only church with the fullness of the means of salvation. 

# Part I: A Church in Crisis

## Chapter 1: A Time of Confusion and Division
_**Summary**: There is serious confusion in the Church over very important matters of doctrine and morality. Rome is at fault not for directly heretical teaching, but rather for sowing confusion and ambiguity and not offering direct clarification._

**Confusion in the Church**
- [[Joseph Ratzinger|Ratzinger]] identified this as the "dictatorship of relativism" (21, cf. *[[2023-01-16 Ratzinger Dictatorship of Relativism Homily|Ratzinger Dictatorship of Relativism Homily]]* [[bib]])
- "Underneath the surface of our culture, steadily working away to destroy the faith, is a demonic intellectual and cultural rebellion that many trace to the "[[Enlightenment]]" but which has deep roots in Eden and has bee nat work ever since." (22; he goes on to summarize the argument of *[[2022-10-31-The Drama of Atheist Humanism|The Drama of Atheist Humanism]]* [[bib]])
- [ ] #read Article on [[German Catholic Church]]: [Rahner’s Ghost - Crisis Magazine](https://www.crisismagazine.com/opinion/rahners-ghost) (444 cf 25)

**The Current Confusion**
- It began with Pope Francis' "Who am I to judge?" comment (23)


## Chapter 2: Is There a Solid Place to Stand?
_**Summary**: We need to stand firmly on the foundation of of Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium._

**Scripture** (it all starts here)
- There are many faithful and vibrant resources on Scripture today: *[[~Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus of Nazareth]]*, *[[~Verbum Domini|Verbum Domini]]*, *[[~Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture New Testament Set|Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture]]*, *[[~Inspiration and Interpretation|Inspiration and Interpretation]]*, *[[~Encountering the Living God in Scripture|Encountering the Living God in Scripture]]* [[bib]] (46)
- But there are also those who **bracket Scripture** by omitting relevant context or challenging passages (49), justified for "psychological difficulty" (51)
- [[John Paul II]]: we must pass on the faith "whole and entire, in all its rigor and vigor" (56, cf. *[[~Catechesi Tradendae|Catechesi Tradendae]]* [[bib]])
- [[Robert Cardinal Sarah]]: we must read and trust scripture (58, cf. *[[~The Day is Now Far Spent|The Day is Now Far Spent]]* [[bib]])

>Scripture is a fire, a rock, a power, a lifeline, an urgent warning, a privileged communication, a source of life-saving knowledge, the key to happiness, and a profound love letter! (58)

- Fr. Francis Martin: the written Word leads us into relationship with the Living Word, Jesus himself (59)

>We should devour and treasure God's Word as our most precious possession. "Thy words were found, and I ate them, and thy words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart." (59, [[Jer-15#v16]])

- To interpret scripture, we must trust the Tradition of the Church as well as her Magisterium, given clearly today in the *[[~Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]* [[bib]], which is an "authoritative and irreplaceable guide to what the Catholic Church actually believes and teaches." (62)
- [[Development of Doctrine]] (63):
	- see [[John Henry Newman]]: *[[~An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine|An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine]]* [[bib]]
	- St. Vincent of Lérins: development is *progress* (improved in itself), not *change* (turned from one thing into another)

>Once we depart from a truly Catholic understanding of the authority and reliability of Scripture and tradition, there is no longer a foundation to stand on, and Christianity has no defense from the cultural pressures of the time that insist that we accommodate ourselves to them. (64)

## Chapter 3: Is It All a Game? The Fog of Universalism
_**Summary**: Examine how [[Universalism]] undermines holiness, evangelization, and vocations. _



## Chapter 4: The Revolution Continues
_**Summary**: ==The sexual revolution==_

**The [[German Catholic Church|German]] Factor**
- The German church is *rich* because Catholic-registered taxpayers pay 8-9% of their income to the church
- The German church is *powerful* because—due to its riches—it funds churches in many poorer countries, who seek to please their benefactor 
- The German church is *progressive* because it is not at risk as are churches that are not state-supported in other developed countries, and because it seeks to be "updated" in the eyes of an increasingly secular populous 


## Chapter 5: How Long Will You Straddle the Issue?
_**Summary**: Religious fervor surrounding secular causes and the alliance with the Church._



## Chapter 6: Is Anyone Responsible?
_**Summary**: The dominant focus on determining culpability as a means of denying mortal sin._

<div class="warning"> <p>Ralph Martin's argument is that there are a lot of people in the church today doing gymnastics making arguments that diminish culpability—especially in the realm of sexual morality—and making people at least perceive that it is "less wrong" or "more alright" that they don't adhere to the law (both natural and of the Church). However, he says that rather than seeking to determine culpability, we should focus on calling everyone to a life of repentance and obedience to God.</p> </div> 

- ==add to the chapter on culpability as an example of the thinking Martin criticizes== 
	- [[2023-01-11 Article-The Sweetness of the Yoke of Christ]]
	- note that it quotes a lot of encyclicals, but no scripture 



# Part II: Pathways Forward 
*Pathways forward that, if followed, can lead us to deep renewal in the Church.*

## Chapter 7: Seeing and Not Seeing
_**Summary**: We need to stop pretending that things are ok. Non-radical solutions may not be enough to right the ship._



## Chapter 8: Powers, Principalities, and Organizations 
_**Summary**: Supernatural forces are at play, and demons are at work in the world._



## Chapter 9: Pastoral Passivity: Good Shepherds and Bad
_**Summary**: There is a crisis of passive pastors who don't live up to the bold preaching of the Gospels._



## Chapter 10: The Signs of the Times: Pointing toward Judgment
_**Summary**: ==God's Judgement is real.==_



## Chapter 11: A Time for Repentance
_**Summary**: ==We must repent.==_



## Chapter 12: A Time for Action
_**Summary**: ==Specific actions everyone can take==_



## Chapter 13: The Inexhaustible Riches of Jesus: Participating in the Prophetic Mission of Jesus 
_**Summary**: ==Sums of the whole message of the book==_
