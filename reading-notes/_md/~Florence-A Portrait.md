## Prologue: Seriously Seeking Florence 
*read [[2025-04-11-Fri]]*
- "In one sense, there is no need to write books explaining what the Florentine Renaissance was, in so far as the visual arts are concerned. Florence is filled with buildings, sculpture, and paintings which 'explain' the phenomenon better than any words." (2)
- "The Renaissance was by no means a purely Florentine phenomenon, but one might well assume ith ad been, having read a typical book on the subject or having visited the city. At every turn, a Renaissance achievement is apparent." (2)
