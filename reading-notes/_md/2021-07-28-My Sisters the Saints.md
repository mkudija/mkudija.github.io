## Chapter 1: [[St. Theresa of Ávila]]
**Summary**: She feels lost and empty in her life of college debauchery and secular feminism, but starts reading **Theresa of Ávila** over Christmas break and sees how it’s never too late (and we’re never too far gone) to turn back to God.

- *Saint Theresa of Ávila* by Marcelle Auclair from her dad: "It makes Theresa come alive" (12)
- her parents read the saints' lives again and again --> we need to be continually uplifted (12)
- *[[~Autobiography of St. Theresa of Ávila]]* (15)
- It's never too late: Theresa's breakthrouh came when she was 39
- Persevering in prayer left her with "more tranquility and happiness than at certain other times when I had prayed because I had wanted to." (18)


## Chapter 2: [[St. Thérèse of Lisieux]]
**Summary**: Her deepening love for **Thérèse of Lisieux**’s little way as she saw her father decline with Alzheimer’s, and his increasing joy as he grew closer to God.

- *Therese: A Life Of Therese Of Lisieux* by Dorothy Day (31)
- Louis Martin: "I know why God has ent me this trial. I never had any humiliation in my life; I needed one." (38)
- her dad: "You're in God's hands." (48)
- Thérèse's signature insight: "Jesus cares more about the love we put into our acts than the acts themselves" (51)


## Chapter 3: [[Maria Faustina Kowalska]]
**Summary**: **St. Faustina** as a model in trusting the lord as she discerned leaving a prestigious White House job to marry her husband and be with her ailing father. True freedom is not license, but a commitment that costs you and trusting God to see you through.

- Kowalska revealed to her the link between trust and humility (81)
- "My Catholic faith reawakened a desire intrinsic to my feminine nature, one the world had convinced me to suppress for to long" (84)
- "The only way to gain that trust was to act as if I already had it, to step out in faith with nothing other than God's hands to catch me if I fell." (88)
- Freedom: "It was only in sacrificing something for love that I had found release." (90)


## Chapter 4: [[Edith Stein]]
**Summary**: Her struggles with infertility and the spiritual motherhood and authentic feminism taught by **Edith Stein**.

- John Paul II's writings on women (102):
	- *On the Dignity and Vocation of Women*, *Letter to Women*, and *The Gospel of Life* by John Paul II
- Edith Stein saw her conversion to Catholicism as a fulfillment, not repudiation, of her Jewish heritage, and "read her way into the Church" (104)
- She devoured Theresa of Ávila's *Autobiography* in one night and declared: "This is the truth." (104, cf *[[2021-07-20-Witness to Hope]]* 538)
- Edith Stein's solution for misdirected love of God (111, [[Spiritual Disciplines]]):
	- 1. **Thoroughly objective work**: forces us to submit to laws outside ourselves and escape our obsessive focus on ourselves, helps us develop self-control
	- 2. **Structure your day to be open to God's grace** ([[Daily Routine]]): Fidelity to Christ requires stamina, which perishes if not refreshed by the wellspring of grace (Confession, Eucharist, Adoration)
		- Attend mass in the morning and ask God how he wants you to spend your day
		- Noontime break to reconnect with God
		- Offer your day back to God at night
- "You cannot give what you do not possess." (113)
- ref the National Catholic Bioethics Center for questions on [IVF](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e3ada1a6a2e8d6a131d1dcd/t/5eb9a41375cd202d4ca2c276/1589224467980/IVFPreachingPoints.pdf), among other things (120)



## Chapter 5: Mother Teresa
**Summary**: The decline of her father into Alzheimer’s and the resulting dark night of her faith as she came to understand through **John of the Cross** and **Mother Teresa**: we don’t have to understand our cross, we just have to carry it.

- Suffering: "God does not abandon us in our suffering but uses suffering to draw us closer to him." (138)
- "**God still allows evil in the world as the price of our freedom.** Yet through his suffering, Christ transformed our trials into a means of grace, a way that we can participate in his redemptive work on earth while awaiting eternal life with him in heaven." (138)
- ***The Collected Works of St. John of the Cross*** (139)
	- key to his thinking, something highlighted that I want to find in John but couldn't when flipping through it for a bit (140)
- *Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light: The Private Writings of the Saint of Calcutta* (141)
	- the closer we are to God, the more we suffer
- "I knew I was teetering on teh brink of a dangerous cliff. The only safe thing I knew to do was to keep showing up for daily Mass, keep reading scripture, keep confessing my sins, and keep visiting my parish's Eucharistic adoration chapel." (159)
- Thérèse and Mother Teresa both made vows to refuse Jesus nothing (163)
- "God is God, and I am not...In the face of such mystery, the only appropriate response is humble gratitude." (167)
- [[Spiritual Disciplines]]: pray the rosary every day (170)


## Chapter 6: [[Mary]]
**Summary**: **Mary** is our universal mother, who helped her through her challenging pregnancy.

- [Memorare by Danielle Rose](https://youtu.be/H93HaDeg27c) (173)
- True devotion to Mary must always lead closer to Christ and remain rooted in Christ (186)
- Mary's sinless nature made living in our sinful world especially painful (195)
- Mary shows us how motherhood requires a willingness to surrender
