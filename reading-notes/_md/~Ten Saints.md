`(Providence: Cluny, 1936/2025), 176`


- "Nobody ever saw [[St. Martin of Tours]] angry or disturbed, lamenting or laughing. No one ever saw anything but a heavenly joy on his face. He seemed beyond the nature of men; nothing showed on his countenance but Christ. Nothing in his heart but piety, peace, and pity." (23-24)
