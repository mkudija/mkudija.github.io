`(New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1918), 77`

This is a beautiful novel of repentance, conversion, and hard work! 

- "Dear old [[St. Joseph]]. Do you know, he's always been my ideal of a perfect [[gentleman]]." (19)
- "The peace and the stillness were so profound that Joline felt she must breathe very softly." (26)
- "I must consider this in [[solitude]] and prayer. Stay here. I will return in half an hour." (39)
- "There was a power in his serenity that must make even the most jocose *fille de joie* give pause and wonder if there might not indeed come divine response to the prayer of such a man." (39-40)
- "I truly believe there are chosen times when the spirit of the Holy Mother herself looks forth through the eyes of some good woman." (41)
- "As for your sins, my child, I have learned from our Redeemer Himself the message to be given you. His words are, 'Go, and sin no more.'" (44-45, cf. [[Jn-08#v11]])
- "The Cathedral-Platz looked different to Joline; she had seen it nearly every day for three months, but now it seemed like the open page of a great book. She read enthralling meanings in every corner of its medieval architecture." (45)
- "I have sinned, but God knows and the Holy Virgin knows I have repented. That's why I am walking now to Alsace." (61)
- "She had a purpose in life now; someone to work for and to love." (64)
- **"Dreams long dwelt on amount to prayers, and prayers wrought in faith come true."** (65)
- "It is high time she was painted as she appeared in her mature years, crowned with sorrow. You notice here that she is not looking at the roses, but at the thorns. I believe the mother of Christ, after the Crucifixion, saw nothing else when she looked at a rose-treeâ€”saw and felt only the pain of the thorns on His brow." (68)
- "I am poor in one way, but very rich in another. I have that which money can not buy...A good conscience." (73)
- "Hands worn and torn by labor are hallowed by their resemblance to the wounded hands of the Crucified One. To me they are beautiful." (76)
