Review: [REVIEW: Reentry, by Eric Berger - by John Psmith](https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-reentry-by-eric-berger?publication_id=1271258&post_id=149641281&isFreemail=true&r=xah9r&triedRedirect=true)
- Haywood Algorithm for Business Success: make a list of everything you need to do, and then do all of it.
- "What makes this book so good is that most of it is just stories of a rocket company following the Haywood Algorithm."
- “Musk wandered around asking anyone at hand — technicians, junior engineers, and company vice presidents alike — the same question: ‘What can we do to go faster?’” In some sense this entire book is just answer after answer to that question: “What can we do to go faster?” 
- "SpaceX is one of the purest and most brutal meritocracies you’ll ever see."
- "SpaceX truly blurs the boundary between a company and a religious movement."
- "If you are reading this review, then like most people on Planet Earth you probably already have an opinion of Elon Musk. The most important takeaway for you from this book is that whatever your opinion currently is, it probably isn’t extreme enough."
- And the purest expression of Elon’s cultural influence, the thing he has chosen to spend all his reputation capital within the company on, is: “What can we do to go faster?”
- "The other unusual thing for which I think Elon gets sole, individual credit is the way SpaceX has stayed nimble despite becoming a very large and successful company. Part of why startups move so fast is that they have so little to lose. If a startup is pondering some risky activity — a challenging research program, or a major product redesign, or an edgy marketing campaign, or an uncertain hiring approach — the decision makers know, in their heart of hearts, that the startup is default-dead anyway, so they might as well roll the dice. Big companies are vastly less likely to engage in these risky activities because doing so could destroy billions of dollars of enterprise value. The secret weapon of SpaceX is that anytime they’re tempted to fall prey to loss-aversion, and to quietly shelve some big risky plan because it threatens to derail the valuable business they’ve already built, Elon shows up and screams and threatens to fire everybody unless they do the risky thing."
- "Elon and SpaceX behave the way that they do because they believe that stuff very sincerely. A version of SpaceX that merely became worth trillions of dollars, but never enabled the colonization of Mars, would be a disastrous failure in Elon’s eyes. Every bit of company strategy is evaluated on the basis of whether it makes Mars more or less likely. This fully explains all the choices that look crazy from the outside. SpaceX does things that look incredibly risky to conventional business analysts because they reduce the risk of never getting to Mars, and that’s the only risk that matters."
- PR: "More seriously, one of the company’s lowest points came in the aftermath of the CRS-7 mission, when a rocket exploded two and a half minutes after launch and totally destroyed its payload. Most companies would do everything possible to minimize the risk of the following “return-to-flight” mission. SpaceX instead used it to debut a completely untested overhaul of the rocket and to attempt the first ever solid ground landing of an orbital-class booster. (It succeeded.)"
- "Permission to fail in public is one of the most powerful assets an organization has, and it flows directly from the top. This, too, is something for which Musk deserves credit."
