## Chapter 1:  
- history of Boeing  
  
## Chapter 2:  
- history of 737  
- developed as me-too competitor to Douglas ?? on the cheap  
- engineering B-team won with moving engines from tail to wings to add more seats  
- got a kick in demand after deregulation when airlines moved to hub and spoke and needed more short haul

## Chapter 3: Jack Welch Look Out  
- “McDonnell Douglas bough Boeing with Boeings money”  
  
## Chapter 4: Hunter killer assassins  
- Boeing tried to be like GE, starting a Crotonville look-alike and focusing on return on assets
## Chapter 5:  
- hunter-killer assassins (McDonnell bean counters) vs Boy Scouts (Boeing engineers)  
- choose unit costs over quality  
- move corporate HQ to Chicago to be away from operations  
  
  
## Chapter 6: The Corporate Playbook  
- Mcinerny  
- the decision to outsource the 787 created issues, dealing with which shelved plans for a clean-sheet 737 replacement

## Chapter 7: The Forrest Gumps  
- switching oversight from the FAA to airlines  
  
## Chapter 8: Countdown Clock  
- development of MCAS as a software (rather than hardware) fix to the pitch-up tendency in tight turns from the forward mounted wings)  
- MCAS billed as a “tweak of the electronic control system” rather than a new system  
- “any change must buy its way onto the airplane”  
- engineers advocated for “synthetic airspeed” (electronically blended from multiple sensors to guide against issues from sensor failures), but was scrapped  
- testing: “how long do you want to keep polishing that apple?”  
  
==Interesting to hear all this and compare to SpaceX culture…==
  
## Chapter 9: Human Factors  
- profit incentives in the training division led to replacement of Boeing pilots with contract pilots, hurting the feedback loop to engineering  
- MAX makes first flight. In flight testing they expand MCAS to low speeds which requires just AOA indicator (no accelerometer). The simulator tested what would happen with low speed activation but without the cacophony of alters and stick shaker like a real situation would entail  
- MCAS certification was based on an old version of the software, not the production version
