* 9/11 - collapse of the towers was caused by the high energy released from the jet fuel in the resulting fire that weakened the steel structure
* Terrorist nukes - unlikely they would be able to assemble a team to build a real nuke
* Dirty bombs - not much risk: high radiation risk to terrorists making/transporting the bomb and low radiation risk when spread over a large area
