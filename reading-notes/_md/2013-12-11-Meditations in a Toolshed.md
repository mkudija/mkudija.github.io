# Meditations in a Toolshed by C.S. Lewis

* looking at something and looking along something are different, but not one better than the other
* in modern thought, we tend to favor looking at and discount looking along: "That is why a great deal of contemporary thought is, strictly speaking, though about nothing - all the apparatus of though busily working in a vacuum."
* "We must, on pain of idiocy, deny from the very outset the idea that looking at is, by its own nature, intrinsically truer or better than looking along.  One must look both along and at everything."
