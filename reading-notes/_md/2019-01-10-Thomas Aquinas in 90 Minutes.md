- “Under present conditions a belief in the ultimate consistency of the world is no more justifiable than a belief in God.” (10)
- “with his talents and family connections he could easily have become the archbishop of Naples...”: interesting to think how he could have been a forgotten archbishop rather than what he is
- he admired and was inspired by Francis of Assisi 
- with the rediscovery of Aristotle and faced with new scientific discoveries in the period, medieval Christians needed to reconcile faith and reason (~30)
- Chesterton describes Aquinas as “Organized common sense” (47)
- Feynman’s “next great era of awakening of human intellect” is qualitative and points back to Aquinas (50)
- Thomas is essentially practical, especially in his politics (like Aristotle) (54)
- The author is no real fan of Aquinas: When Descartes published *Discourse on Method*..."Modern philosophy had begun, and the cobwebs of Aristotle and Thomism were swept away forever." (72-73)
