# *Rumsfeld's Rules* by [[Donald Rumsfeld]]


* When at the bottom, learn from those at the top
* Who you work with is often more important than where you work 
* Chapter 2 is about running good meetings 

You Can't Predict the Hero by Joe Grano
* Near the end of chapter 1 he talks about how any success comes with selfish goals with resort to time spent with family vs time spent working...makes me think about priorities and how I should choose family 
* Problems require solutions, not scapegoats
    * The best way to overcome bureaucratic problems is to keep on excelling and proving yourself 
* Be the eternal optimist
* Reconcile yourself to selfishness
    * People need to be incentivized effectively 
* You can't predict the hero
* People do what you pay them to do (incentives)
* Humanity is more important than hierarchy
* One of the biggest lessons from the 2008 financial crisis is that there is no security without liquidity
