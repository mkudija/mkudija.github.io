## Introduction to the Ignatius Catholic Study Bible 
*by [[Scott Hahn]]*

## The Catholic Church and Sacred Scripture 
*by [[Jeffrey L. Morrow]]*

## The Catholic Canon of Scripture 
*by [[Matthew J. Thomas]]*
- ...
- "[[St. Augustine|Augustine]] insists that both the original Hebrew texts and the Septuagint editions are authoritative, since it was the same Spirit who inspired both the prophets and the later translators." (32, cf. *[[2017-01-03-The City of God#^06deea]]*)

## Overview of Salvation History 
*by [[John Bergsma]]*


## Notes 
- "[[2 Mc-12]] provides the single biggest reason [[2024-01-31-Why Catholic Bibles Are Bigger|why Protestant bibles are shorter]] than Catholic ones" (1704)

- [[John Bergsma]] [said](https://youtu.be/qIYoaVxK44E?list=PLVSZX1XnJiVvHEUEpwaKnSD8f2ctXRuiZ&t=407) that the ICSB would be smaller if they could get thinner Bible paper. By my measurement, the ICSB paper measures ~0.0021" thick per sheet, vs ~0.0014 on the [[~Cambridge ESV Diadem Reference Bible with Apocrypha Red Calfskin|Cambridge ESV Diadem]] and [[~Schuyler Quentel ESV with Apocrypha|Schuyler Quentel ESV]]. Using that thinner paper could shave about 35% off the thickness of the ICSB, though it might be challenging to use with paper that thin given it's large dimensions.
