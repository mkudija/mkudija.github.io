## Foreword by [[Rod Dreher]]
- Men have forgotten God, and man (cf. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]])
- Ordinary Christians need a better grip on the modern condition, this book through the lens of [[Philip Rieff]]
- Transgenderism as the "ultimate expression of the spirit of modernity"


## Introduction
- That the sentence "I am a woman trapped in a man's body"—so loaded with metaphysical assumptions—can be regarded as coherent and meaningful is the motivation for this book
- Thesis: the **sexual revolution** cannot be understood apart from the broader transformation in our understanding of **selfhood**
	- **sexual revolution**: the normalization of sexual phenomena (pornography, homosexuality, etc.) and positive repudiation of traditional sexual mores
	- **selfhood**: our purpose in life, what constitutes a good life, how I understand myself in relation to others (cf Charles Taylor)
- **"The task of the Christian is not to whine about the moment in which he or she lives but to understand its problems and respond appropriately to them."** (30)
- "giving an accurate account of on'es opponents' views is vital" (30)
