## VI

- "You must keep on shoving all the virtues outward till they are finally located in the circle of fantasy, and all the desirable qualities inward into the Will. It is only in so far as they reach the will and are there embodied in habits that the virtues are really fatal to us." (37)


## VIII

- [[Free Will]]: "The Irresistible and the Indisputable are the two weapons which the very nature of His scheme forbids Him to use...He cannot ravish. He can only woo. For His ignoble idea is to eat the cake and have it; the creatures are to be one with Him, but yet themselves." (46)
- [[Prayer]]: "The prayers offered in the state of dryness are those which please him best." (47)
- Stumbles: "He wants them to learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand; and if only the will to walk is really there He is pleased even with their stumbles." (47)

## XIII

- real, simple pleasures, like reading a book
- "when they are wholly His they will be more themselves than ever" (68)
- "You should always try to make the patient abandon the people or food or books he really likes in favour of the 'best' people, the 'right' food, the 'important' books." (69)

## XIV

- [[Humility]]: "All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has them, but this is especially true of humility." (71)

## XV

- [[Eternity]] and the present: "The humans live in time but our Enemy destines them to eternity. He therefore, I believe, wants them to attend chiefly to two things, to eternity itself, and to that point of time which they call the Present. For the Present is the point at which time touches eternity." (76)

## XVIII

- [[Marriage]]: "The truth is that wherever a man lies with a woman, there, whether they like it or not, a transcendental relation is set up between them which must be eternally enjoyed or eternally endured." (94)

## XXI

- We belong to God: "They will find out in the end, never fear, to whom their time, their souls, and their bodies really belong—certainly not to *them*, whatever happens." (110)

## XXVII

- Learning: "And since we cannot deceive the whole human race all the time, it is most important thus to cut every generation off from all others; for where learning makes a free commerce between the ages there is always the danger that the characteristic errors of one may be corrected by the characteristic truths of another."
