- "...how little our stuff matters once we've let it go." (37)
- "Let's be real. Nobody wants a fine oak dining room set anymore. And there are so many, and you can't get rid of them." (77)
- "Fabrics labeled `100 PERCENT COTTON` often aren't; and cotton-polyester blends often contain more polyester than the tag claims." (162)
- No evidence that car seats actually expire... (198)
- "I was raised tha the smartest thing you can do is buy a rich person's broken thing. The best deal you can negotiate is when the rich person doesn't know how easy it is to fix." (228)
- Kyle Wiens, Atascadero, CA, ifixit (230)
- Give cash or gift cards instead of things for gifts (188)
- Solutions to put more into the secondhand economy: improve longevity and repairability of goods, buy longer-lasting items, view waste as an opportunity (190)
- **Preemptive Morbid Decluttering** (PMDC): "I imagine myself dead and all my stuff chucked. Sad right? So better let go now, especially if I can see the recipient and know the stuff will be loved or used." (274)
