# Writing to Learn by William Zinsser
- Preface
    - he is a “generalist in a land that prefers narrow expertise” (viii)
    - “We write to find out what we know and what we want to say. I thought of how often as a writer I had made clear to myself some subject I had previously known nothing about by just putting one sentence after another-by reasoning my way in sequential steps to its meaning..writing and thinking and learning were the same process” (viii-ix)
