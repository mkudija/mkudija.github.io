## Foreword
>We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy y didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
>
>But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another—slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: [[Aldous Huxley]]'s *[[~Brave New World]]*. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, **people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think**.
>    
>**What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one.** Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in *Brave New World Revisited*, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In *[[~1984]]*, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In *[[~Brave New World]]*, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, **Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us**.
>    
> This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.

## Chapter 1: The Medium is the Metaphor
**Summary**: Our tools for thought shape that very thought, and our metaphors create the content of our culture. We are undergoing a transformation from *writing* to *electronics* that will be just as monumental the prior transformation from *speech* to *writing*. 
- The city that embodies our age is Las Vegas, the city of entertainment
- His argument has roots in [[Plato]], that the *forms* of our conversation have importance (i.e. you can't do philosophy with smoke signals, and you cannot to political philosophy on television)
- "We attend to fragments of events from all over the world because we have multiple media whose forms are well suited to fragmented conversation...Without a medium to create its form, the news of the day does not exist." (8)
- [[Marshall McLuhan]]: "the medium is the message" (8)
- The 2nd commandment to not make idols ([[Ex-20#v4]]) does not make sense "*unless its author assumed a connection between forms of human communication and the quality of a culture*" (9)
- "The media of communication available to a culture are a dominant influence on the formation of the culture's intellectual and social preoccupations." (9)
- "What is peculiar about such interpositions of media is that their role in directing what we will see or know is so rarely noticed. A person who reads a book or who watches television or who glances at his watch is not usually interested in how his mind is organized and controlled by these events" (11) --> this is taken to a new level with the internet and social media
- Lewis Mumford in *Technics and Civilization* argues that the mechanical clock, by distancing us from nature and eternity, has done as much as [[Enlightenment]] philosophy distance man from God (11-12)
- [[Plato]] recognized the monumental shift from *speech* to *writing*—we are now engaged in the monumental shift from *writing* to *electronics*. This represents a transformation in our way of thinking. (13)
