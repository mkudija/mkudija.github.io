# *Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less* by Greg McKeown
2018-02-17


## Themes
- Only a few things really matter
- Almost everything is noise

## Chapter 1: The Essentialist
- Missed his baby for a meeting: “If you don’t prioritize your life someone else will.”

## Chapter 2: Choose
- Despite decision fatigue and learned helplessness, you can decide. Step back to do so.

## Chapter 3: Discern
- Pareto principle, and the best are 10k x more productive. Essentialists spend a lot more time exploring options so they can find the really impactful things to focus their effort on. Push only the levers that matter most.

## Chapter 4: Trade-offs
- Don’t straddle: don't try to implement conflicting strategies. You must choose.
- J&J credo in stone
- “There are no solutions, only trade-offs”...”don’t ask what I have to give up, ask what I want to go big on”

## Chapter 5: Escape (Solitude)
- Deliberately set aside distraction free time in distraction free space to think 
- He wrote this book 5 am- 1pm 5 days per week
- Read classic literature for the first 20 min of the day: Zen, Reason of unreason, Bible, Ghandi, Walden, Mormon, Marcus Aurelius, Upanishads 

## Chapter 6: Look
- Journalism: look for the lead, not just the facts but why it matters
- He recommends keeping a journal; and this has been a huge impact since I started in September 2015
- But every month or 90 days you need to read your journal and look for the patters and “leads” 

## Chapter 7: Play
- Play is essential to broadening our horizons, helps relieve stress, and helps our brain's executive function

## Chapter 8: Sleep
- Protect your asset (you)

## Chapter 9: Select
- “Either hell yes or no” - Derek Sivers 
- Say yes to only the top 10% of opportunities 
- If it isn’t a clear yes, it’s a clear no
- Career: what am I deeply passionate about, what taps my talent, and what meets a need in the world? 
- What do you really want out of your career over the next five years?

## Chapter 10: Clarify
- Goals must be inspirational but also concrete

## Chapter 11: Dare
- How to say no with grace...

## Chapter 12: Uncommit
- Sunk costs on Concorde program
- Admit failure to begin success: you’re only admiring that you’re now wiser than you once were 


## Chapter 13: Edit
- subtract and refine

## Chapter 14: Limit (Set Boundaries)
- Set boundaries early and firmly because it’s a slippery slope 
- Boundaries are like the Christian concept of freedom: freedom for rather than freedom from
- Forcing people to solve their own problems helps both of you


## Chapter 15: Buffer (the unfair advantage)
- Create buffers to prepare for the unexpected 

## Chapter 16: Subtract
- *The Goal*: find constraints
- Make a one-time investment in removing obstacles

## Chapter 17: Progress
- the power of small wins

## Chapter 18: Flow (routines)
- Use routines to free up your mind


## Chapter 19: Focus (be present)
- You can do multiple things at the same time, but you can’t concentrate on multiple things at the same time
- Mindfulness 


## Chapter 20: Be
- Live a life of simplicity and meaning
- He tried to tie it to major religions 
- Clarity = success

Two major lessons he learned: 
1. Family is most important 
2. We don’t have much time left and it is precious
