# Volume 1

### *The Unity of the Catholic Church* by [[St. Cyprian of Carthage]]
- On [[Papacy]]:" "In order that unity might be clearly shown, He established by His own authority a source for that unity, which takes its beginning from one man alone...If someone does not hold fast to this unity of the Church, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he resists and withstands the Church, can he still be confident that he is in the Church...?...Whoever is separated from the Church and is joined to an adulteress is separated from the promises of the Church...He cannot have God for his Father who does not have the Church for his Mother...Whoever holds not fast to this unity holds not to the law of God; neither does he keep faith with the father and the Son, nor does he have life and salvation." (220-221)
- [[Daily mass]]: "And we ask that this bread be given us daily, so that we who are in Christ and daily receive the Eucharist as the food of salvation, may not, by falling into some more grievous sin and then in abstaining from communicating, be withheld from the heavenly Bread, and be separated from Christ's Body...He himself warns us, saying, 'Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you ([[Jn-06#v54]]).' Therefore do we ask that our Bread, which is Christ, be given to us daily, so that we who abide and live in Christ may not withdraw from His sanctification and from His Body." (223)
