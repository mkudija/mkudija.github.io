`(New York: Grove, 1941/1956/1962), 174`

- "Until you can say 'The criminal coming at me? The criminal coming at me is I!,' you can not know the [[Stoic]] philosophy." (10)
- "Exegesis is the mother of heresy." (10)
- [[Writing]]: "The composition of vast books is a laborious and impoverishing extravagance." (15)
- "These declarations are all meant to insinuate a unitary God who accommodates Himself to human diversities. To my mind, the idea is not very stimulating." (41)
- "(what is worse) charming us with the primary idea that all epochs are the same, or that they are different" (48)
- "I cannot imagine the universe without the interjection of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]" (50)
- "My general memory of *Don Quixote*, simplified by forgetfulness and indifference, is much the same as the imprecise, anterior image of a book not yet written." (51, cf. *[[2021-06-01-How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read|How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read]]*)
- "To think, analyze and invent are not anomalous acts, but the normal respiration of the intelligence." (54)
- *[[2021-09-16-The Inferno|The Inferno]]* Canto X [[bib]] (74)
- "Of the various pleasures offered by literature, the greatest is invention." (78)
- "From my weakness I drew strength that never left me." (92)
- "A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely." (97)
- "When a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others." (98, cf. *[[2022-06-06-Four Thousand Weeks|Four Thousand Weeks]]*)
- "The heterogeneous census of the authors whom I continually reread is made up of [[Schopenhauer]], De Quincey, Stevenson, Mauthner, Shaw, [[G.K. Chesterton]], LÃ©on Bloy." (106)
- "The truth is that we all live by leaving behind." (113)
- [[Notetaking]]: "To think is to forget a difference, to generalize, to abstract. In the overly replete world of Funes there were nothing but details, almost contiguous details." (115)
- "What one man does is something done, in some measure, by all men. For that reason a disobedience committed in a garden contaminates the human race; for that reason it is not unjust that the crucifixion of a single Jew suffices to save it." (120-121)
- [[Generalism]]: strive to not be this man: "The man does not exist who, outside his own speciality, is not credulous." (144)
- [[Forecasting]]: "reality does not tend to coincide with forecasts about it." (144-145)
- Fourth Eclogue of [[Virgil]] [[bib]] (149)
- "He disposed of no document but his own [[Memory]]; the mastering of each hexameter as he added it, had imposed upon him a kind of fortunate discipline" (149)
- "[[Eternity]] of the instant" (170)
- Favorite stories:
	- *Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote* 
	- *The South* ("perhaps my best story")
	- *The Secret Miracle*
