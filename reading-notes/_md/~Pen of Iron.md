## Prelude: America as a Scriptural Culture
- America saw itself as the new Israel entering the new Promised Land, making the Old Testament more meaningful than the New (Hebrew being required, but Greek not) 
- The language from the 1611 KJV Old Testament continues to pervade our culture to this day 
- This book: "I should like to try to se how the language of the King James Version is worked into the texture of the writing, making possible a king of strong prose that would not have existed otherwise, and I shall seek to understand how this prose serves as the vehicle for certain distinctively American constructions of reality." (5)
	- focus is on *style*, not theology, symbols, or ideas
