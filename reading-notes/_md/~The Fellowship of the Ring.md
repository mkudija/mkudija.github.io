### Prologue
- "The Hobbits name it the Shire...and there in that pleasant corner of the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved." (6)
- [[Fasting]]: "They were so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without them." (6)

### Book I
- "Don't go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you'll land in trouble too big for you." (24)
- "Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays." (28)
- "Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender." (29)
- Bilbo: "I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve." (31)
- [[Phrases to use]]: "You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?' 'Yes, I will—two eyes, as often as I can spare them." (34)
- "It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free." (36)
- "'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. **All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.**'" (55-56) ^f2cb0a
- "Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope." (60)
- "I can put it not plainer than by saying that Bilbo was *meant* to find the Ring, and *not* by its maker. In which case you also were *meant* to have it. And that may be an encouraging thought." (61)
- "Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. **For even the very wise cannot see all ends.** I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it." (65)
- "Such questions cannot be answered." (67)
- "I should like to save the Shire, if I could- though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. But I don't feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again." (68)
- "Courage if found in many unlikely places." (95)
- "Yes, sir. I don't know how to say it, but after last night I feel different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want- -I don't rightly know what I want: but I have some- thing to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me." (98)
- "You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin- to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours--closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone." (118)

### Book II
- "Merely to be there was a cure for weariness, fear, and sadness." (252) 
- "But in metal-work we cannot rival our fathers, many of whose secrets are lost." (257)
- **"Yet oft in lies truth is hidden."** (299)
- "This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere." (302, cf. [[St. Thérèse of Lisieux]]'s little way)
- "I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way." (303)
- "The future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over the present." (307)
- "It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish." (405)
- "Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feed, though you do not see them." (413)
- "For we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make." (416)
- "For I know what I should do, but I am afraid of doing it." (446)
