    * The whole introduction is a great manifesto on patience, waiting, and reflection
    * "Knowledge is only good if you can reflect on it." 
* He talks about how to be a writer, especially an opinion writer, with the purpose of changing the world
    * you need set of values that informs what you advocate for
    * you need to have a coherent view of the world
    * it needs to be inspired and informed by real people, not just abstract principles
