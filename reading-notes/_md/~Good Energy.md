## Introduction 
- "Preventable lifestyle conditions are responsible for 80 percent of modern human deaths." (xi)
- "Good Energy" aka metabolic health: whether your cells have the energy to do their jobs (xii)
- Many health conditions are linked to metabolic issues, "Bad Energy" (xiii)
- "Disease isn't some random occurrence that might happen in the future. it is a result of the choices you make and how you feel today. If you are battling annoying and seemingly nonlethal health issues and underlying contributor to these conditions is generally the same thing that will lead to a 'major' illness sometime later in life if nothing changes in how you care for your body." (xiv)
- "The reality is that every institution that impacts health makes money on 'managing' disease, not curing patients." (xvii)
- "We are locked into a reductionist, fragmented view of the body that breaks us into sdoens of separate parts. This view does not foster human flourishing." (xviii)
- "The next revolution in health will come from understanding how the root of almost every disease relates to energy, and how [[Generalism|less specialization]], rather than more, is the answer." (xviii)
