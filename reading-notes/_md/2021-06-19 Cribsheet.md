## Introduction
- parenting theme: you have less control than you think you do; but you do have *choices*, and those choices are important (xv)
- optimize not just for the baby, or for yourself, but for the overall family (xvii)
- **Economics framework for decision-making** (xix): needs to account for all of **costs**, **value of time**, **options**, and **preferences**
>Too often we focus on the benefits at the expense of thinking about the costs. But benefits can be overstated, and costs can be profound. (xxii)

	- (cf. [[Cal Newport]]'s thinking on the overstated benefits and profound costs of social media use)
- there are some questions the data can't answer for your --> uncertainty (xxii)
- **[[Avoiding Cognitive Dissonance]]**: we want our choices to be right, so after we make them we encamp ourselves as advocates of them (xxiii)
	- I see this all the time in people giving career advice: I want to have made the right decision so you should do what I did
	- This misses the point that your choices can be right for you but not other people. That's ok; people's constraints differ

## Chapter 2: Newborns
***Summary**: Medical interventions are extreme for very young infants, so minimizing exposure to germs and other risks early on is reasonable, but no so much later on.*



## Chapter 3: Childbirth Recovery
***Summary**: Discussion of mom's recovery from childbirth.*


# The First Year

## Chapter 4: Breastfeeding
***Summary**: Breastfeeding leads to some short-term health benefits for baby and a reduction in breast cancer risk for mom, but data does not suggest long-term health or cognitive benefits for baby.*

**An aside on research methods**: types of research studies (70-72):
- **Randomized Controlled Trial**: recruit a large number of people and randomly assign to treatment groups, the gold standard 
- **Observational Studies**: compare groups *without* random assignment, 
- **Case Control Studies**: identify cases, then identify controls (used for vary rare events)
- **Controls**: variables we can hold constant while varying the variable of interest


## Chapter 5: Breastfeeding How-To
***Summary**: Breastfeeding is hard! Early skin-to-skin helps, nipple confusion (with a bottle/pacifier) not supported in the data, etc.*


## Chapter 6: Sleep Position and Location
***Summary**: *

- Thinking about sleep risks (i.e. SIDS) (113):
	- Put sleep risks in the context of risks that we implicitly accept every day (i.e. driving)
	- Recognize that sleep choices have real quality-of-life impacts
