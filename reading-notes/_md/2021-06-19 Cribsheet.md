## Introduction
- parenting theme: you have less control than you think you do; but you do have *choices*, and those choices are important (xv)
- optimize not just for the baby, or for yourself, but for the overall family (xvii)
- **Economics framework for decision-making** (xix): needs to account for all of **costs**, **value of time**, **options**, and **preferences**
>Too often we focus on the benefits at the expense of thinking about the costs. But benefits can be overstated, and costs can be profound. (xxii)

	- (cf. [[Cal Newport]]'s thinking on the overstated benefits and profound costs of social media use)
- there are some questions the data can't answer for your --> uncertainty (xxii)
- **[[Avoiding Cognitive Dissonance]]**: we want our choices to be right, so after we make them we encamp ourselves as advocates of them (xxiii)
	- I see this all the time in people giving career advice: I want to have made the right decision so you should do what I did
	- This misses the point that your choices can be right for you but not other people. That's ok; people's constraints differ
