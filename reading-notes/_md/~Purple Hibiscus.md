`(New York: Algonquin Books, 2012-04-17), 321`

- this illustrates the points James makes in his letter that faith without works is dead, and that even the demons believe in Jesus.  
- her dad misses the point that works are out of love  
- also millstones and the responsibility of teachers: we can’t just tell our kids what to think, we must teach them how to love. And teaching them correctly but not loving well is dangerous because it can drive them from the true faith to something less true, but more “loving”
- Ironic that she references James 5 in Ch 3 right after I thought about the below!
