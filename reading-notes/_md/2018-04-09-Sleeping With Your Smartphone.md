*How to Break the 24/7 Habit and Change the Way you Work*: all about her work with BCG to implement PTO to bring more predictability and work-life balance to their crazy consulting schedules.

# Introduction
- this book shares the BCG story and is a guide for implementing PTO in your organization
- "The Cycle of Responsiveness": always on leads to expectation to be always on in vicious cycle --> you need to set expectations
- **PTO = predictability + teaming + open communication**


# Part I: How A Team Turns Off
- started with one predictable night off per week
- reinstated the "Pulse check"
  - How are you feeling?
  - How much value are we delivering to the client?
  - How satisfied are you with your learning?
  - Is the current operating model sustainable for you?
- **PTO**: Collective goal of predicable time off + Structured dialogue = Better work and better lives
- 1. Collective goal must be:
  - Personally valued by everyone
  - Doable but still a stretch
  - Collective and shared
  - Requires integrative thinking
  - A means, not just an end
- 2. Structured dialogue

- Chapter 5: writing a daily update to a team blog makes you think twice about what you to do make sure it is value added


# Part II: The Magic of the Process

# Part III: Getting Started On Your Team
- the team leader's role is critical: they must be on board and read this to be successful (naturally)
- gives example slides and meeting agenda for introducing this to a team

# Part IV: From Team to Organization
