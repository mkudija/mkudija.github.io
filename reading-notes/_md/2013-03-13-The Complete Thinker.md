`(San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2012), 265`

## Introduction
- "When Chesterton says something we are immediately delighted by its truth, but we are also pleased with the package it arrives in." (12)
- Chesterton is clarifying: he answers questions rather than just asking them (13)
- Chesterton's great accomplishment is that, in addition to writing about everything, he puts it all together: he is a *complete thinker* (14)
- Reading Chesterton is almost a complete education in itself...he doesn't fit into any single academic department (14)
- Ahlquist's view of a complete thinker: 
	1. Grasping the hierarchy of knowledge 
	2. Thinking worthwhile thoughts
	3. Knowing how to fill in the gaps in our knowledge 
	4. Using both [[faith and reason]]
- "Chesterton is a giant of the faith, and a model of confidence in the truth." (20)

## Notes 
- Existence itself is a gift, and the only appropriate response to a gift is gratitude (29)
- "To become a Catholic is not to leave off thinking, but to learn how to think." (30, cf. *CW* 3:106)
- Against [[relativism]]: "There is a whole truth of things, and that in knowing it and speaking it we are happy." (35)
- Truth must pass five tests (36): 
	- It is consistent 
	- It does not change 
	- It is distinctive 
	- It is whole 
	- It is good 
- "It is difficult to believe that people who are obviously careless about language can really be very careful about anything else." (45)
- [[Philosophy]] is for everyone (48) and all communication is translation (50)
- "The [[problem of evil]], which has been a classic objection to the Christian faith, is actually evidence *for* the Christian faith. Evil proves that the claims of Christianity are valid. The Church teaches that there is an enemy. In a strange way, evil points to the good, even to the truth, because it is always pointing away from it." (63)
- Happiness is based on obedience, what Chesterton calls (in *[[2014-10-06-Orthodoxy|Orthodoxy]]*) "the Doctrine of Conditional Joy" (66)
- "It is not drink but drunkenness that is evil. Anything that takes away our free will is evil." (78)
- "Purity is the beginning of all passion" (80)
- "You can only represent very big ideas in very small spaces." (90)
