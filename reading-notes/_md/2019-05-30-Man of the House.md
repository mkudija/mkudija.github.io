`(Eugene: Resource, 2017), 139`

## Foreword
- "Without a father there is no family." (ix)

## Introduction
- we need to build the household because it small and in our control, rather than big and remote (xiii)
- a household is a general-purpose institution (xvii)

# The Framework of a Household

## Chapter 1 - Covenants
- technological progress can mask regression in other areas --> read old books (3)
- marriage is the foundation of the household (7)

## Chapter 2 - One Flesh
- the household is the most basic community (polis) of all (15)

## Chapter 3 - The Economy of Love
- the household economy is based on giving (of ourselves) (20-21)
- within a household, a man and a woman enjoy a sheltered space that makes it possible for them to fully give themselves to each other (21)

# Household Economics

## Chapter 4 - Property
- you need to acquire and maintain *productive property*
- productive property gives the household economy something to work on together (30)
- productive property gives us roots, develops virtue, and provides shelter (31-32)

## Chapter 5 - Work
- ownership is freedom and wage earners are not owners (39)
- owning productive property is as close as you can get to real economic security (40)
- if you earn a wage, at least make it a trade school for you to learn marketable skills (43)
- *general competence* (in the categories of mechanical skills, organizational skills, people skills, and aesthetics) is essential if you want to master freedom (44)
- a household can (should be able to?) do many things well enough (44)

## Chapter 6 - Help
- have children

# Household Polity

## Chapter 7 - Justice
- justice depends on respect, and people possess authority because they are authors (68)
- the best way to reinvest household headship with authority is by giving households something worthwhile to do, and everything is at stake in the household (71)
- umbilical cord: before you can adjudicate interests you need to separate people (75)

## Chapter 8 - Gravitas
- get gravitas through self-mastery, knowledge, and glory

## Chapter 9 - Piety
- first, set yourself apart: you are the priest of your house (95)
- second, honor others
- third, institute and guard symbols of authority

# Outside the House

## Chapter 10 - The Principalities
- stay put and contribute to the common good (106)
- take back responsibility from the government (and prepare for the day when the government cannot provide what it now does) (110)

## Chapter 11 - Friendship
- to be happy in our houses, we shouldn't expect too much from the people we live with (115)
- true friends are drawn by goodness itself, and mediated by the Church (122)

## Chapter 12 - Legacy
- the true wealth of a healthy household is the productive capacity of its members (125)
- we should strive to give our children *virtue*
