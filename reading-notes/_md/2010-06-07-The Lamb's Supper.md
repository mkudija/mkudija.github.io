# *The Lamb's Supper* by [[Scott Hahn]]

- Melchizedek - [[Gn-14#v18]], [[Heb-07#v1]] (16).
- Read [[Ps-22]] - "Why have you forsaken me" ultimately ends in salvation (33).
- When making the sign of the cross, three fingers together represent the trinity and the two fingers together represent the humanity and divinity of Christ (44).
- "Making the Sign of the Cross, then, is like swearing on the Bible in a court of law" (45).
- Does the reference to "daily bread" in the Our Father suggest daily mass attendance? (55).
- "The Church teaches that Mary was perpetually virgin" (79).
- Each church has a guardian angel (86).  >> Does each chapel at ND have a guardian angel?
- "In Revelation ([[Rv-14#v4]]), we also encounter a large number or men consecrated to virginity" (88).  â†’ Deaconate or priesthood?
- "This is what was unveiled in the Book of Revelation: the union of heaven and earth, consummated in the Holy Eucharist" (125).
- "Those are the tough battles...But because they're so perfectly hidden, so interior, they require greater heroism" (144).
