- "Every single choice matters, no matter how small. Everything you choose to read, listen to, or look at. Everything you think about, dream about, or focus on. And especially your circle of friends can make all the difference in who you become." (9)
- Focus on the process and control the controllables (18)
- "Nothing is a test. Everything is an opportunity to learn and grow, because you are building your own house." (22)
- "Uncomfortable isn't a choice, but where you experience it is." i.e. choose to control the times you feel uncomfortable (27)
- [[Phrases to use]]: **"The grass is greener where you water it."** (45)
	- "I never gave up, and I realized the whole time I was building my own house. A sensei shared with me that very same story about Kota building his own house, and I realized that it wasn't about what I was doing, but rather about who I became. John, let me tell you two very important things: comparison is the thief of all joy, and the grass isn't greener on the other side. _**The grass is greener where you water it.**_ You have grown up in a society where things like social media and twenty-four hour television have established a culture that is hyper-focused on comparison. But if you are constantly comparing, you will have all the joy sucked out of you. You must focus on your journey, yours alone."
- "Goals allow you to shirk responsibility but mission is owned only by the person in the mirror." (73)
- Take two minute gratefulness walks (77)
- "In order to reach your greatest potential you must operate with a heart of gratitude, commit to the controllables, surrender the outcome, and trust the process." (78)
- Avoid partially-controllable goals
