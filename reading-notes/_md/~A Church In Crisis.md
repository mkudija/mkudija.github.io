<div class="success"> <p><strong>Summary: </strong>The Church is in crisis (as usual), and renewal comes through individual turning away from sin and toward God (as usual).</p></div> 

<div class="info"> <p><strong>Thesis: </strong>The Church is experiencing a crisis across many fronts—especially a pervasive attitude of universalism and relativism that minimizes culpability for sin, the backlack from the sexual revolution leading to apostasy as the Church accommodates itself to the world, and disordered priorities that deny the Gospel in favor of more attractive secular causes—all of which supported recently by what is at best a lack of clarity or at worst a studied ambiguity from Rome. The path forward starts with individual repentance and renewal of our participation in the prophetic mission of Jesus, set aflame by the Holy Spirit.</p></div>

## Introduction 
*[A Crisis of Truth (PDF) | Renewal Ministries](https://www.renewalministries.net/shop/product/a_crisis_of_truth_pdf)*
- Ralph Martin wrote *[[~A Crisis of Truth|A Crisis of Truth]]* [[bib]] in 1982
- The leadership of [[John Paul II]] and [[Joseph Ratzinger|Benedict XVI]] addressed many of the concerns he raised in that book, but many of these have arisen anew recently. This book treats many of the same topics in light of their current manifestation. 
- What is at stake is the proper interpretation of [[Vatican II]], along the lines either of the *hermeneutic of rupture*, or the authentic *hermeneutic of continuity* [with the Tradition]
- Despite this crisis, the Catholic Church is the Church that Christ founded, and remains the only church with the fullness of the means of salvation. 

# Part I: A Church in Crisis

## Chapter 1: A Time of Confusion and Division
_**Summary**: A survey of the problems to be examined in more detail throughout._


**Confusion in the Church**
- There is serious confusion in the Church over very important matters of doctrine and morality. Rome is at fault not for directly heretical teaching, but rather for sowing confusion and ambiguity and not offering direct clarification. (16)
- His view on [[Pope Francis]]:
	- *[[2013-12-02-Evangelii Gaudium|Evangelii Gaudium]]*:

**The Current Confusion**
- 


## Chapter 2: Is There a Solid Place to Stand?
_**Summary**: Reaffirm the reliability of Scripture, tradition, and the magisterium._



## Chapter 3: Is It All a Game? The Fog of Universalism
_**Summary**: Examine how [[Universalism]] undermines holiness, evangelization, and vocations. _



## Chapter 4: The Revolution Continues
_**Summary**: ==The sexual revolution==_

**The [[German Catholic Church|German]] Factor**
- The German church is *rich* because Catholic-registered taxpayers pay 8-9% of their income to the church
- The German church is *powerful* because—due to its riches—it funds churches in many poorer countries, who seek to please their benefactor 
- The German church is *progressive* because it is not at risk as are churches that are not state-supported in other developed countries, and because it seeks to be "updated" in the eyes of an increasingly secular populous 


## Chapter 5: How Long Will You Straddle the Issue?
_**Summary**: Religious fervor surrounding secular causes and the alliance with the Church._



## Chapter 6: Is Anyone Responsible?
_**Summary**: The dominant focus on determining culpability as a means of denying mortal sin._



# Part II: Pathways Forward 
*Pathways forward that, if followed, can lead us to deep renewal in the Church.*

## Chapter 7: Seeing and Not Seeing
_**Summary**: We need to stop pretending that things are ok. Non-radical solutions may not be enough to right the ship._



## Chapter 8: Powers, Principalities, and Organizations 
_**Summary**: Supernatural forces are at play, and demons are at work in the world._



## Chapter 9: Pastoral Passivity: Good Shepherds and Bad
_**Summary**: There is a crisis of passive pastors who don't live up to the bold preaching of the Gospels._



## Chapter 10: The Signs of the Times: Pointing toward Judgment

## Chapter 11: A Time for Repentance
_**Summary**: ==We must repent.==_
