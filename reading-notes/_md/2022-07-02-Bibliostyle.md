- I don't want to sound pretentious but I don't understand people who don't have books. <br> —Emmanuel de Bayser (59)
- I cannot live without a library, and I cannot live without a garden. A garden is where we negotiate with nature—a place between the wild and the tame—and a library is where we confront everything. <br> —Vik Muniz (99)
- There's more to life than books, you know. But not much more. <br> —Coralie Bickford-Smith (205)
