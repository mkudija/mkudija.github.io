# *Excellent Sheep* by William Deresiewicz

* Chapter 2 talks about helicopter parents limit their will: "The helicopter parent turns the child into an instrument of her will; the overindulgent parent projects his own need for a limitless freedom and security. In either case the child is made to function as an extension of someone else."
* Chapter 8 talks about how we live in a scientistic world that places science above all of the arts, which reminded me of Robert Barron’s description of the “[[Scientism]]” of the world that places science over all other forms of knowing
