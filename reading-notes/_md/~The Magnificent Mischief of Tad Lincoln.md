Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a national holiday in October 1863. "The last Thursday of November next as a day of Thanksgiving to the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sings, hath nevertheless remembered mercy." ([Proclamation 106â€”Thanksgiving Day, 1863 | The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-106-thanksgiving-day-1863))
