# Change by Design by Tim Brown

Introduction
* "I realized that behind the soaring rhetoric of 'genius' and 'visionary' was a basic commitment to the principles of design thinking." (6)
Chapter 1 - Getting Under Your Skin or how design thinking is about more than style
* "Linear thinking is about sequences; mind maps are about connections." (9)
* "spaces" of design thinking are iterative and nonlinear (16)
    * inspiration - the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions
    * ideation - the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas
    * implementation - the path that leads from the project room to the market
* "Fail early to succeed sooner." (17)
* "The mark of a designer is a willing embrace of constraints." (17) --> necessary to get started
    * constraints are viewed in terms of feasibility (functionally possible), viability (sustainable business model), and desirability
* The Project: Design thinkers need to think in terms of projects instead of problems: a project carries an idea from concept to reality (21)
* The Brief: mental constraints to give you somewhere to start (22)
* Smart Teams: "all of us are smarter than any of us" (26), organized in many small teams
Chapter 2 - Converting need into demand or putting people first
* Human-centered design has three elements:
    * Insight - learning from the lives of others
    * Observation - watching what people don't do and listening to what they don't say
    * Empathy - standing in the shoes of others
* These principles must extend beyond the individual to the network, market, or "wisdom crowds"
Chapter 3 - A mental matrix or "these people have no process!"
* Types of thinking:
    * Convergent thinking - useful for deciding between existing alternatives (but not good at creating the future)
    * Divergent thinking - objective is to multiply options to create choices
    * Analysis - 
    * Synthesis - organizing and interpreting data to create a coherent story; extracting meaningful patterns from raw data
* Rules for an attitude of experimentation
    * Best ideas emerge when the whole organization can experiment
    * Those most exposed to changing externalities are the best placed to respond
    * Ideas should not be favored based on who creates them
    * Ideas that create a buzz should be favored
    * Senior leadership should tend, prune, and harvest ideas --> "risk tolerance"
    * An overarching sense of direction should be articulated so there is a sense of direction and not a constant need for supervision
* Culture of optimism - the unshakable belief that things could be better than they are
* Brainstorming - a structured way of breaking out of structure
    * Defer judgment
    * Encourage wild ideas
    * Stay focused on the topic
    * Build on the ideas of others
Chapter 4 - Building to think or the power of prototyping
* prototyping is faster because it helps you to think
Chapter 5 - Returning to the surface or the design of experiences
* a good idea is no longer enough - in developed societies we care about the experience of products
* our society is moving away from passive consumption to active participation
Chapter 6 - Spreading the message or the importance of storytelling
* we rely on storytelling to put our ideas in context and give them meaning
Chapter 7 - Design thinking meets the corporation or teaching to fish
* a
Chapter 8 - The new social contract, or we're all in this together
* a
Chapter 9 - Design activism, or inspiring solutions with global potential
* a
Chapter 10 - Designing tomorrow, today
* Design thinking requires bridging the knowing-doing gap (Pfeffer and Sutton) (227)
* most people have what it takes to apply design thinking to the problems of life
* Begin at the Beginning
    * design thinking starts with divergence (expand the range of options)
* Take a human-centered approach
    * design thinking is by its nature integrative, but privileges the intended user
    * account for emotional meaning as well as functional performance
    * common approaches
        * Start with prevailing business constraints --> leads to incremental, easily-copied ideas
        * Start with technology --> risky
        * Start with humans --> increases the likelihood of a breakthrough and a market for it
    * Get as close as you can to your intended customers
* Fail early, Fail often
    * there is nothing wrong with failure as long as it happens early and is a source of learning
    * prototyping
* Get professional help
    * to to the experts
* Share the inspiration
    * knowledge sharing should support inspiration instead of efficiency
    * face to face time is invaluable
* Blend big and small projects
    * there is no silver bullet, only silver buckshot
* Budget to the pace of innovation
    * rethink funding schedules, agile resource allocation
* Find talent any way you can
    * find the people in your organization who are different and can make innovation happen
* Design for the cycle
    * make sure your person career life cycles are not shorter than the product cycle: want the same people and passion
* Don't ask what, ask why?
    * ask why to reframe a problem, redefine the constraints, and open the field to a more innovative answer
    * is this the right problem to be solving?
* Open your eyes
    * good design thinkers observe, great design thinkers observe the ordinary: once a day, stop and think about an ordinary situation
* Make it visual
    * record your observations and ideas visually
    * "Every designer I know carries a sketch pad the way a doctor carries a stethoscope." (238)
    * "Don't think.  Look." -Ludwig Wittgenstein (238)
* Build on the ideas of others
    * all of us are smarter than any of us
* Demand options
    * don't settle for the first good idea
* Balance your portfolio
    * document the process
* Design a life
    * think of life as a prototype
