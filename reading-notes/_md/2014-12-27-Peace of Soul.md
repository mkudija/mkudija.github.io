* “There is a world of difference between knowing about God through study and knowing God through love - as great as the difference between courtship carried on by mail and one by personal contact.” (59-60)
* "When a person is not right on the inside, there can be nothing right in his outside activities." (105)
* chapter 8 - we need to focus more on life than on sex 
* "False isolation of the part from its whole is a common trait in contemporary thought" (166)
