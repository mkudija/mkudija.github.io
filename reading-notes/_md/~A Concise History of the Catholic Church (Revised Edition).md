## Chapter 20: [[Martin Luther|Luther]] Splits Christendom
* Luther's struggles started with his inability to gain holiness through his own effort, leading to his emphasis on justification through faith alone and the complete assurance of salvation it providedâ€”good works serve to increase our faith or to bring us more deeply into Christ's righteousness. (187-190)
* The church of his day was in a terrible state of affairs especially around indulgences. Clerics were interested primarily in political power and money (includingâ€”with disappointment, the [[Dominican]] Johann Tetzel). Luther proposed his 95 theses as a way to engage in an academic debate about the issues, but they struck a chord with Germans frustrated with the abuses of the Church. The Church failed to engage or respond in a charitable way, lending credence to his criticisms. (191-195)
* Luther took up the charge, and in doing so moved farther away from Catholic doctrine, affirming to *sola scriptura* and rejecting [[Transubstantiation]], celibacy, apostolic succession, 5 of the [[Sacraments]], etc. (195-198)

## Chapter 21: [[John Calvin|Calvin]] Makes Protestantism
- Was the "theological genius" of Protestantism, Saw himself as Luther's successor, and agreed with him on scripture alone, salvation by faith, priesthood of all believers (205)
- His theology is rooted in Scripture, and started with the Sovereignty of God (205), which led to his theology of [[Predestination]] which was his Achilles heel (206)
	- [ ] Calvin differed from Luther on the canon of scripture? ðŸ“… 2022-11-05 (205)
- Calvinism grew from Geneva and became the main form of Protestantism in the non-Lutheran (Germany/Scandinavia) countries (208)
- Ironic that Henry VIII wrote *The Defense of the Seven Sacraments* against Luther, and his reformation was motivated by political rather than religious reasons (210)
- The was a lengthy shuffling of Puritan (Calvinist), Episcopalian (still believed in bishops), and traditional factions within the Church of England after its formation. This led to the Calvinist exodus to New England and greatly influenced American history. (212)
