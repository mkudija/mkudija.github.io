<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h1 id="techniques-to-reinforce-a-culture-of-freedom-and-responsibility">Techniques to Reinforce a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility</h1>

<h2 id="chapter-7-max-up-talent-density">Chapter 7: Max up Talent Density</h2>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The Keeper Test</p>

<ul>
<li>The Keeper Test: "Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at another company, would I fight hard to keep?"</li>
<li>Avoid stack-ranking systems which create competition and discourage collaboration</li>
<li>A sports team is a better metaphor than a family: keep the best player in each position</li>

<li>Performance reviews are not the best mechanism for candid feedback since they only go one way and involve one person</li>
<li>A 360 written report is a good mechanism for annual feedback but make sure it is not anonymous</li>
<li>Live 360 dinners are effective for feedback in a Start, Stop, Continue format</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-9-eliminate-most-controls">Chapter 9: Eliminate Most Controls</h2>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:  Lead with context, not control</p>

<ul>
<li>Leading with context is best when you goal is innovation (not error prevention), and requires a loosely coupled system</li>
<li>Instead of telling people what to do, get into alignment by providing and debating all the context that will allow them to make good decisions</li>
<li>When someone on your team fails, ask yourself what context you forgot to set</li>
<li>A loosely coupled organization should resemble a tree rather than a pyramid: the boss is at the roots, holding the trunk of senior mangers who supports the branches where decisions are made </li>
</ul>
