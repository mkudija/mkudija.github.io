# Reading Notes

Full [reading list](https://matthewkudija.com/reading).

I have been recording notes on what I read since about 2010, with varying fidelity and level of detail. 

- Many books that I read as hard copies have notes and underlines in the physical book. These are transcribed with varying levels of completeness, if at all.
- Books I read in college are likely either not represented or under-represented, since these notes are contained in my Notre Dame Summary.
- Books I read as eBooks often have quotations directly copied electronically and may not have page numbers that correspond with the printed book.
- Books I listened to as Audiobooks likely are missing detailed citation information.

In June 2021 I switched my reading notes from [here](https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading/notes) to this current location. The master location for these notes is now in Obsidian (`Obisidian/Reading Notes/`) so that I can more easily take notes as I go and connect ideas between notes.
