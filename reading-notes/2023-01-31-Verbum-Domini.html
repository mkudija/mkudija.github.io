<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><img src="http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SNA<em>YgEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;source=gbs</em>api" width=150></p>

<p><code>(Rome: Vatican, 2005), 199</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read the divine Scriptures frequently; indeed, the sacred book should never be out of your hands. <em>(72, cf Jerome)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading this is timely in three ways: given the recent death of Pope Benedict and a desire to more deeply read his works, having read the <a href="2022-12-31-The-Bible-in-a-Year-(with-Fr.-Mike-Schmitz).html">The Bible in a Year with Fr. Mike Schmitz</a> last year and continuing this year, and currently reading the <a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Catechism of the Catholic Church.md">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>. There is in fact a great overlap between <em><a href="2022-12-03-Dei-Verbum.html">Dei Verbum</a></em>, the first part of the <em>CCC</em>, and the first part of <em>Verbum Domini</em>. Hearing the same passages quoted and the same ideas said slightly differently helps to cement these important ideas about God's word in my mind. </p>

<p><em>Verbum Domini</em> is beautiful and rich and wide-ranging. A few key reminders are that Scripture is intimately bound up with the Church and the Liturgy, we need the Holy Spirit to properly interpret Scripture, and that Scripture needs to be lived (not just read). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"To receive the Word means to let oneself be shaped by him, and thus to be conformed by the power of the Holy Spirit to Christ" <em>(50)</em></p>
