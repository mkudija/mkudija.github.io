<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>He was inspired to write the book because he was born in 1953 when Elizabeth was coronated and every child born in Britain that year was given a copy of the KJV (ix)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li>most influential, along with <a href="../notes/Shakespeare.html">Shakespeare</a></li>

<ul>
<li>Collapse of feudalism and rise of a new merchant class </li>
<li>Gutenberg's printing press </li>
<li><a href="../notes/John-Wycliffe.html">John Wycliffe</a> advocates for translating the Bible into English </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-the-rise-of-english-as-a-national-language">Chapter 2: The Rise of English as a National Language</h2>

<ul>
<li>French and Latin were the languages of the English elite. Translation of the Bible into English was seen as a pointless debasement: direct knowledge of the biblical text itself was seen as too dangerous to permit to the laity, and English was regarded as not sophisticated enough to cope. with the great themes of the Bible</li>
<li>The Fifteenth century saw the dawn of English nationalism, spurred along by greater adoption of a national language </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-3-the-great-tumult-the-reformation">Chapter 3: The Great Tumult: The Reformation</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/Martin-Luther.html">Luther</a> started writing in German rather than Latin to appeal to a more popular audience. And he translated the Bible into German: if the Bible were available in the vernacular, all could read it and judge the teachings of the Church for themselves  (52)</li>
<li>Two underlying ideas of <a href="../notes/Martin-Luther.html">Luther</a> (55):
<ul>
<li>The Church had lost sight of the basic teaching that salvation is a gift form God, not earned as a reward </li>
<li>The key to reform and renewal was to put the Bible into the hands of the laity </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Erasmus re-translated the Vulgate from the original Greek, correcting errors he found (57)</li>
<li>Henry VIII's reformation in England prepared the way for an English translation </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-4-the-first-printed-english-bibles">Chapter 4: The First Printed English Bibles</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/William-Tyndale.html">William Tyndale</a> admired Luther's German translation and resolved to do the same in English; he is now widely acknowledged as the most formative influence on the text of the King James Bible (67)</li>
<li>Tyndale's 1526 New Testament was smuggled into England and created great pressure for an English Bible, which was banned under the Constitutions of Oxford (73)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Miles-Coverdale.html">Miles Coverdale</a> produced the first full Bible in English in 1535 (89); more of a compilation of others' translations than a fresh translation, which rose and fell with the favor of Anne Boleyn (90)</li>
<li>Next came Richard Grafton's "Matthew's Bible", but "England was simply not ready for such strong Protestant meat" in its footnote (93)</li>
<li>Coverdale slightly revised Matthew's Bible to make it acceptable to churchmen, and it became the "Great Bible" (94)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-5-explaining-the-hard-places-the-geneva-bible">Chapter 5: Explaining the "Hard Places": The Geneva Bible</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Geneva Bible (1560) was the main Bible the KJV had to displace: it was a translation of the full Bible (including <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a>) with radical Protestant notes associated with Geneva at the time (99)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-6-a-puritan-king-the-accession-of-king-james">Chapter 6: A Puritan King? The Accession of King James</h2>

<ul>
<li>Elizabeth put forward compromises to appease both Catholics and Protestants, but these were unpopular with the emerging Puritans, radical Protestants who objected to the use of vestments and the Prayer Book (133); gradually the tension between Catholics and Protestants was replaced with the tension between Anglicanism and Puritanism (134)</li>
<li>James VI ascended as a critic of Puritanism and the Geneva Bible (141), which undermined a notion of the "divine right of kings" (148)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-7-the-decision-to-translate-the-hampton-court-conference">Chapter 7: The Decision to Translate: The Hampton Court Conference</h2>

<ul>
<li>James wanted a united Protestant England against Roman Catholicism, helped by a new translation of the Bible </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-8-translation-the-englishing-of-the-bible">Chapter 8: Translation: The Englishing of the Bible</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Bishop's Bible was the base of the KJV translation </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-9-production-the-early-printings-of-the-king-james-bible">Chapter 9: Production: The Early Printings of the King James Bible</h2>

<ul>
<li>KJV was authorized by the king, but privately funded throughout</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-10-translators-and-traitors-the-problems-of-bible-translation">Chapter 10: Translators and Traitors: The Problems of Bible Translation</h2>

<ul>
<li>"The Fourth session of the <a href="../notes/Council-of-Trent.html">Council of Trent</a> (1546) produced a detailed canonical list, which included some of the works of the <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a> as authentically scriptural, while the Protestant congregations in Switzerland, France, and elsewhere produced lists that deliberately omitted reference to these works, or else indicated that they were of no importance in matters of doctrine." (223)</li>
<li>KVJ translators were divided into six companies, each assigned a portion of the Bible. The Second Cambridge Company was responsible for the Prayer of Manasses and the rest of the Apocrypha (218-219)</li>
<li>Notes that Article VI of the <a href="../notes/Thirty-Nine-Articles-of-Religion.html">Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion</a> regards the <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a> as not suitable to "establish any doctrine" (225)</li>
<li>"The decision to include the <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a> was taken by Richard Bancroft...it was not particularly controversial at the time; the Geneva Bible had also included it. Yet it was a decision that would <em>become</em> controversial in later years." (226)</li>
<li>The <a href="../notes/Westminster-Confession-of-Faith-(1646).html">Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)</a>, Article III (226)
<ul>
<li><em>"The books commonly called <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a>, not being divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings."</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Puritans and their nonconformist successors in the eighteenth century wanted the <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a> excluded on theological grounds, and missionaries wanted them excluded so that Bibles could be produced as cheaply as possible (227)..."Missionary societies gradually came to view that the <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a> would be omitted—primarily for financial, rather than theological reasons" (228)
<ul>
<li>The first to do so in 1826 was the British and Foreign Bible Society, which "gave a major stimulus to the growing trend to publish Bibles without the <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a>" (228)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The KJV didn't generate much interest initially, with people preferring to stick with the Geneva Bible (278). Acceptance of the KJV coincided with the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 and the publication of the <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~1662 Book of Common Prayer.md">Book of Common Prayer</a></em> (1662)</li>
<li>"The King James translators seem to have taken the view—which corresponds with the consensus of the day—that an accurate translation is, by and large, a literal and formal translation," such that English has been enhanced by idioms drawn from Hebrew (252)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-11-the-bible-and-the-shaping-of-modern-english">Chapter 11: The Bible and the Shaping of Modern English</h2>

<ul>
<li>The KJV greatly impacted the English language, but style was not apparently an aim of the translators: their primary concern was to provide an accurate translation (254)</li>
<li>English displayed willingness to absorb loanwords from other languages, making it a rich medium of expression and facilitating its rise as a global trade language (258); this was influenced by the KJV (259)</li>
<li>Discusses various literary elements of the KJV, and concludes: "these points suggest that the King James Bible would actually have been perceived to be slightly old-fashioned and dated even from the first day of its publication." (276)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-12-triumph-the-final-acclamation-of-the-king-james-bible">Chapter 12: Triumph: The Final Acclamation of the King James Bible</h2>

<ul>
<li>The first English Bible brought to America was a Geneva Bible, which was favored by Puritans (293)</li>
<li>"The lowest common denominator of English-speaking American Protestant Christianity, especially in the nineteenth century, was the King James Version of the Bible." (294)</li>
<li>Robert Aitken published the first KJV (without the <a href="../notes/Deuterocanonical-Books.html">Apocrypha</a>) in the United States in 1782 (298)</li>
<li>"Other translations will doubtless jostle for place in the nation's bookstores in the twenty-first century. Yet the King James Bible retains its place as a literary and religious classic, by which all others continue to be judged." (300)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="afterword">Afterword</h2>

<ul>
<li>"The glory of the King James Bible was that the English language was raised to new heights by being put to the service of this supreme goal—the rendering in English of the words and deeds of God." (305)</li>
<li>Translations eventually require revision, not necessarily because they are defective, but because the target language changes over time (308)</li>
<li>"Those who insist that we retain the King James Bible as the only English translation of the Bible actually betray the intentions and goals of those who conceived and translated it—namely, to translate the Bible into living English." (309)</li>
