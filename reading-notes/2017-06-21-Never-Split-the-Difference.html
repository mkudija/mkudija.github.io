<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 - 
<ul>
<li>Ask open ended ("calibrated") questions: buys you time and gives them the sense of control</li>
<li>Negotiation can be overly rational and formulaic: we need to keep in mind that we are people and have emotions 
<ul>
<li>Use Kahneman's understanding of our two types of thinking</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use tactical empathy to gain access to the mind of the other</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 2 - Mirroring 
<ul>
<li>Your most powerful tool in verbal communication is your voice</li>
<li>Mirroring (isopraxism), is imitation to establish rapport and lead to trust - we trust what is alike us
<ul>
<li>Repeat the last 3 words (or one important word) they said</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mirroring allows you to disagree without being disagreeable</li>
<li>The intention behind mirrors should always be "please help me understand"</li>
<li>Lessons from this chapter
<ul>
<li>A great negotiator uses his skills to reveal the surprises he is certain to find</li>
<li>Use assumptions as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them vigorously</li>
<li>A negotiation isn't a battle, it's an opportunity to discover information</li>
<li>Make your sole focus the other person and what they have to say</li>
<li>slow it down</li>
<li>put a smile on your face</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Three voices of negotiators
<ul>
<li>Late night DJ: downward inflection calm and slow to make a point with authority without awakening defensiveness</li>
<li>Positive/playful voice: should be default, relax and smile while talking</li>
<li>Direct/assertive voice: use rarely</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 3 - 
<ul>
<li>Empathy: the ability to recognize and vocalize the other person's perspective. You don't have to agree with them, just imagine yourself in their shoes</li>
<li>Tactical empathy: understanding feelings and emotions-and what is behind them-so you can increase your influence</li>
<li>Labeling: validating someone's emotion by naming it
<ul>
<li>use "It sounds like..." rather than "I'm hearing that...": "I" gets people's guard up</li>
<li>After labeling, wait in silence</li>
<li>Labeling diffuses negative emotions and reinforces positive emotions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accusation audit: list everything negative they could say about your to "take the sting out"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 4 - No
<ul>
<li>Allow yourself and the other to say "no", it helps you feel comfortable and somewhat in control. No can mean:
<ul>
<li>I'm not ready</li>
<li>I'm uncomfortable</li>
<li>I need more information</li>
<li>...etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No is a starting point</li>
<li>There are 3 kinds of yes: Counterfeit, confirmation, and commitment</li>
<li>Our primal urges: to feel safe/secure, and to feel in control</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 5
<ul>
<li>"That's right" is better than yes</li>
<li>"You're right" is dangerous</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 6
<ul>
<li>Compromise rarely leads to great results (think one brown shoe and one black shoe)</li>
<li>It is important to know each other's deadlines, but they aren't fixed in stone</li>
<li>"if you approach the negotiation thinking the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong"</li>
<li>The most powerful word in negotiation is "fair": 
<ul>
<li>"we just want what's fair"</li>
<li>"we have given you a fair offer"</li>
<li>"I want you to feel like you're being treated fairly at all times, so please stop me if you feel otherwise"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Anchor their emotions
<ul>
<li>anchor their emotions and expectations low and then play on loss aversion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>let the other guy go first, usually
<ul>
<li>let them anchor and adjust, especially when you don't have all the information</li>
</ul></li>
<li>establish a range
<ul>
<li>understand that if you offer a range they will come in low</li>
</ul></li>
<li>pivot to non-monetary</li>
<li>when you talk numbers, use odd numbers
<ul>
<li>an odd number ($115,500) sounds more exact, calculated, and immovable than a round $110,000</li>
</ul></li>
<li>make a surprise gift - which they will feel obligated to repay</li>
<li>SALARY NEGOTIATION
<ul>
<li>be pleasantly persistent on non-salary terms: builds the right environment for discussion and can lead to higher salary if they can't meet those desires</li>
<li>define success for your position and metrics for your next raise</li>
<li>"what does it take to be successful here": once they give you guidance they have a stake in if you succeed and you have gained a mentor</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 7
<ul>
<li>asking calibrated questions (asking for help) is the most powerful way to suspend unbelief, allows them to focus on solving the problem and gives them the illusion of control</li>
<li>instead of saying what you "need", describe what you are looking for and ask for suggestions</li>
<li>ask: "How am I supposed to do that?"</li>
<li>calibrated questions
<ul>
<li>be open ended, start with "what", "how"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>calibrated questions require self-control 
<ul>
<li>bit your tongue</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 8
<ul>
<li>"yes" is nothing without "how"</li>
<li>signs that they're not on board with you:
<ul>
<li>"you're right" instead of "all right"</li>
<li>"I'll try" means "I plan to fail"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>identify and motivate the players behind the table </li>
<li>Dealing with difficult/aggressive negotiators:
<ul>
<li>7-38-55: % contribution of message, tone, and body language, respectively</li>
<li>Rule of 3: get 3 yeses in the same conversation to confirm you are on the same page</li>
<li>Use your name in your speech as a form of "forced empathy"</li>
<li>use a multi step empathetic no</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 9
<ul>
<li>any response that is not an outright rejection means you have the edge</li>
<li>archetypes of negotiating style:
<ul>
<li>Accommodate</li>
<li>Assertive</li>
<li>Analyst</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ackerman bargaining system (for buying):
<ul>
<li>Set your target (goal)</li>
<li>Set you first offer at 65% target</li>
<li>Calculate 3 raises of decreasing increments (85%, 95%, 100%)</li>
<li>Use empathy and "no" to get the other side to counter before decreasing offer</li>
<li>Use precise, non-round number for your final offer</li>
<li>On final number, throw in a non-monetary item they don't care about to show you're at your limit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 10
<ul>
<li>Black Swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on past experience (unknown-unknown)</li>
<li>never make a threat, but use labels to make the point:
<ul>
<li>"It seems like you value that I've always paid on time"</li>
<li>"It seems like you don't care what position you're leaving me in"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>know your opponent's worldview or "religion"</li>
<li>People trust familiarity: build rapport</li>
<li>Express passion for their goals</li>
<li>Give a reason for your requests </li>
<li>Don't accept that they are "crazy": search to understand why 
<ul>
<li>If they have bad information, they will make bad decisions </li>
<li>Weird behavior might indicate constraints that they haven't revealed</li>
<li>They may have other interests </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get face time</li>
<li>Observe the unguarded moments before and after the actual negotiation </li>
<li>If it doesn't make sense, there are cents ($) to be made </li>
<li>3 types of leverage 
<ul>
<li>Positive (give them what they want)</li>
<li>Negative (hurt them)</li>
<li>Normative (using their norms to bring them around) </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prepare negotiation sheet
<ul>
<li>When the pressure is on, we fall to our highest level of preparation</li>
<li>The goal
<ul>
<li>Think though best/worst case scenarios but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case</li>
<li>Don't focus too much on BATNA since it can be too low and become your goal</li>
<li>Never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better</li>
<li>Write your goal down, discuss it with someone else, and carry the written goal into the negotiation </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Summary
<ul>
<li>Write out a couple sentences to understand facts that led to negotiation </li>
<li>Your counterpart must be able to respond with "that's right"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Labels/Accusation Audit
<ul>
<li>Prepare 3-5 labels to perform and accusation audit</li>
<li>Make a list of accusations they might bring </li>
<li>Then turn that list into labels and role play</li>
<li>Examples
<ul>
<li>It seems like x is valuable to you</li>
<li>It seems like you don't like x</li>
<li>It seems like you value x</li>
<li>It seems like x makes it easier</li>
<li>It seems like you're reluctant to x</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calibrated Questions
<ul>
<li>Prepare 3-5 calibrated questions </li>
<li>Example "how" and "what" questions:
<ul>
<li>What are we trying to accomplish?</li>
<li>How is that worthwhile?</li>
<li>What's the core issue here?</li>
<li>How does that affect things?</li>
<li>What's the biggest challenge you face?</li>
<li>How does that fit in with the objective?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Behind the Table killers (committee) 
<ul>
<li>How does this affect the rest of the team?</li>
<li>How on board are the people not on this call?</li>
<li>What does your boss see as the main challenge?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find deal-killing issues 
<ul>
<li>What are we up against here? </li>
<li>What's the biggest challenge you face? </li>
<li>What happens if you do nothing? </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Noncash Offers
<ul>
<li>Prepare a list of noncash items possessed by your counterpart that would be valuable </li>
<li>What could they give us that would get us to do this for free? </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
