<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><code>(New York: Hachette Books, 2020-12-01), 200</code></p>

<p>I read the chapters 5 to 10 about Fr. Kapaun to the boys after their interest in military chaplains. These chapters were interesting as a fist gloss on his life, which clearly was one of heroic virtue and self-sacrifice for his men. The rest of the book is full of overly simplified explanations of Catholicism, tedious spiritual autobiography, and theology of questionable orthodoxy and not worth the time—a better book about making saints is <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Making Saints.md">Making Saints</a></em>. </p>

<ul>
<li>The "all man" priest: "Father Kapaun did not command anything, but he inspired loyalty, especially among the enlisted men." (73-74)</li>
<li>Mass with Koreans: "Father Kapaun knew that here before the altar they spoke a common lauguage." (77)</li>
<li>Fr. Kapaun, wounded himself, carried more severely wounded men on their POW death march so they would not be left behind or killed. (86)</li>
<li>"He never gave an order. He never lost his patience. He never showed any hint of pain or despair. Father Kapaun was in charge." (90)</li>
<li>"Liewtenant Dowe believe wherever Father Kapaun stood was holy ground. He swore he could turn the most fetid mud hut into a cathedral." (100-101)</li>
<li>"Father Kapaun was right. No matter where you are, joy and glory can be found in your heart." (104)</li>
<li>"When Comrade Sun had the guards take away his rosary, he twisted another one from barbed wire." (109)</li>
<li>Before dying: "I am going to be with Jesus Christ. And that is what I have worked for all my life." (117)</li>
<li>Fink (a Jewish officer) made a crucifix while in prison and led the prisoners in procession when they were freed. (126)</li>
<li>Obama at his Medal of Honor ceremony: "This is the valor we honor today. An American soldier who didn't fire a gun, but who wielded the mightiest weapon of all, a love for his brothers so pure that he was willing to die so that they might live." (130)</li>
<li>"He spent his whole life giving himself up for other people. He lived his whole life following the example of Christ and laying down his life for others. And that's why he is a saint." (133)</li>
</ul>
