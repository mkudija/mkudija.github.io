<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li>we need a "full-fledged philosophy of technology use" (xiv)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="part-i-foundations">Part I - Foundations</h1>

<h2 id="chapter-1-a-lopsided-arms-race">Chapter 1 - A Lopsided Arms Race</h2>

<ul>
<li>recall that the iPhone was originally just designed to be a phone and a music player...the internet connetivity took over later</li>
<li>digital experiences are addictive, especially with respect to <em>intermittent positive reinforcement</em> and <em>the drive for social approval</em> (17)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-digital-minimalism">Chapter 2 - Digital Minimalism</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Minimalism</strong> - A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.</li>
<li>minimalist philosophy: work backwards from your deeply held values when deciding how to live your life (31)</li>
<li>constantly perform cost-benefit analyses</li>
<li><strong>Principles of Digital Minimalism</strong>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><ol><br /><br />
<li><em>Clutter is costly</em>: Thoreau's key insight is that there is a cost in "life" (time) that we need to weight against any benefit</li><br /><br />
</ol></li><br />
<li><ol><br /><br />
<li><em>Optimization is important</em>: remember diminishing returns, but most of us are on the left hand side of the curve and have huge gains to realize through some optimization</li><br /><br />
</ol></li><br />
<li><ol><br /><br />
<li><em>Intentionality is satisfying</em>: for the Amish, intention trumps convenience: intentionally vet technology based on its impact on their core community values</li><br /><br />
</ol></li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-3-the-digital-declutter">Chapter 3 - The Digital Declutter</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Digital Declutter<br />
<ul><br />
<li>For 30 days, put aside optional technologies</li><br />
<li>During this period, rediscover activities and behaviors that you find meaningful (and make decisions about technology use while away from its aura)</li><br />
<li>Reintroduce optional technologies starting from a blank slate. For each determine what value it offers and how to maximize this value. Each technology you include must:</li><br />
<li>Serve something you deeply value</li><br />
<li>Be the <em>best</em> way to use technology to serve this value (if not, replace it with something better)</li><br />
<li>Have an SOP defining <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> you use it</li><br />
</ul></li>

<ul>

<li>"It's not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life" (253)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I need to find a better way of tracking the source and path of ideas. For instance, now I list books I want to read on my Amazon wish list and note who I heard about it from, which helpful especially when recommended from various sources. But I need a comprehensive system for tracking information that comes into my brain, whether it be ideas, book recommendations, articles, etc. This would be particularly useful for evaluating the quality of social media channels. I know I have come across excellent articles and tools on Twitter, but knowing where or who from exactly would be helpful, for instance, in curating the list of people I follow. </li>
<li>I decided while reading this book to modify my method of taking notes when reading a library book I can't write in. Instead of reading with my computer nearby and typing notes into markdown while reading, I folded a piece of paper in half and wrote notes on there which are later transcribed into markdown. I spent a whole evening reading about a third of the book in this manner without touching my phone or computer once. </li>
<li>I culled my Facebook friends down from 534 to 161</li>
</ul>

<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->
