<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>Remember, Jesus himself prayed the psalms, in which we encounter all types of prayer </li>

<li><a href="../notes/Vatican-II.html">Vatican II</a> warmly recommends the LOTH to the laity </li>
<li>The LOTH is the Church's most significant answer in her tradition to the instruction to pray without ceasing (19, cf. <a href="../notes/1-Thes-05.html">1 Thes-05</a> and <a href="../notes/Lk-18.html">Lk-18</a>)</li>
<li>As <em>Liturgy</em>, it is the official, public prayer of the Church </li>
