<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><code>(New York: Ignatius Press, 2000-01-01), 354</code></p>

<p>I read this in 2017, and then recently read it to the boys after they asked about military chaplains. Fr. Goldmann's story is an incredible witness to the power of prayer made in faith and the hand of Divine Providence leading us through even the most terrible suffering. His habit of always speaking the truth is an especially important model. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is better to suffer from physical hunger than to be starved in one's soul. We have finally learned what daily Communion means; how then can we give it up? How could we exchange the bread of the soul for the bread of the body?" (138)</p>
