<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<li>It's never too late: Theresa's breakthrouh came when she was 39</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <strong>St. Faustina</strong> as a model in trusting the lord as she discerned leaving a prestigious White House job to marry her husband and be with her ailing father.

<li>"My Catholic faith reawakened a desire intrinsic to my feminine nature, one the world had convinced me to suppress for to long" (84)</li>

<ul>
<li>Suffering: "God does not abandon us in our suffering but uses suffering to draw us closer to him." (138)</li>
