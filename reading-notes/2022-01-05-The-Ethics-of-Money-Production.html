<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<li>We need re-train ourselves about what money even <em>is</em>: tangible commodity value. We can perform all daily activities without ever touching money (or even cash which is fiat paper). Work, numbers show up on the screen, buy things and numbers get smaller and things show up at the door.</li>
<li>private vs fiat inflation (5)</li>
</ul>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://mises.org/library/ethics-money-production">Mises notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By "money production," the author is speaking not in the colloquial sense of the phrase "making money," but rather the actual production of money as a commodity in the whole economic life. The choice of the money we use in exchange is not something that needs to be established and fixed by government.</p>
  
  <p>In fact, his thesis is that a government monopoly on money production and management has no ethical or economic grounding at all. Legal tender laws, bailout guarantees, tax-backed deposit insurance, and the entire apparatus that sustains national monetary systems, has been wholly unjustified. Money, he argues, should be a privately produced good like any other, such as clothing or food.</p>
  
  <p>In arguing this way, he is disputing centuries of assumptions about money for which an argument is rarely offered. People just assume that government or central banks operating under government control should manage money. Hulsmann explores monetary thought from the ancient world through the Middle Ages to modern times to show that the monopolists are wrong. There is a strong case in both economic and ethical terms for the idea that money production should be wholly private.</p>
  
  <p>In his normative analysis, the author depends heavily on the monetary writings of 14th-century Bishop Nicole Oresme, whose monetary writings have been overlooked even by historians of economic thought.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: This book is an exposition of monetary theory that applies the tradition of philosophical realism to the analysis of money and banking, with special emphasis on the scholastic tradition of <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Nicholas Oresme</text> and <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">St. Thomas Aquinas</text>, as well as <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Austrian School</text> as a champion of the realist tradition and free-market policies.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Murray Rothbard</text> credits Thomism with a critical development in ethics by pointing to the power of reason (even before faith in God)</li>
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Joseph A. Schumpeter</text> credits the scholastics for founding the science of economics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Money is everywhere in our lives but is not usually given a proper moral treatment, at least partially driven by the conflict of interest among economists who are remunerated in some form by the process of fiat inflation. Hülsmann provides an extensive bibliography in the scholastic and Austrian traditions and demonstrates fundamental compatibility between Austrian economics and Christian morals.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The problem: money is everywhere in our lives but not given a proper moral treatment (in traditional economics, Catholic social teaching, etc.)</li>
<li>Money production is a problem of justice because of the legal institutions that control it, and the inflation they cause is a great evil</li>
<li>The introduction (and its copious footnotes) provide extensive additional reading in the <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Austrian School</text><br />
<ul><br />
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Nicholas Oresme</text>'s <em>Treatise on the Alteration of Money</em> is a continual reference point in this text and foundational to the moral treatment of money</li><br />
<li>Economists in the <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Austrian School</text> including: <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Carl Menger</text>, <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Ludwig von Mises</text> (integrated the theory of money and banking within the overall theory of subjective value and pioneered macroeconomic analysis in the realist tradition), <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Murray Rothbard</text> (apex of Austrian theory, integration of ethics)</li><br />
<li>Scholastics and Austrians agree on the <em>integration</em> of economics with larger social phenomena</li><br />
<li>Thomas Woods argues in <em>The Church and the Market</em> that Austrian economics and Christian morals are fully compatible (this is an exception as many contemporary Christian writers agree with pro-inflation doctrines)</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="part-1-the-natural-production-of-money">Part 1: The Natural Production of Money</h1>

<h2 id="chapter-1-monies">Chapter 1: Monies</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Money arises out of the need for a medium of exchange to allow for further division of labor. <strong>Natural Monies</strong> are monies freely chosen when property rights are respected and have intrinsic commodity value prior to monetary usage. <strong>Credit Money</strong> is an IOU for a commodity, while <strong>Paper Money</strong> is forced money without commodity value that has never emerged without coercion or the abuse of property rights.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Money is a partial solution to the challenges of barter</li>
<li>The <strong><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Law of Comparative Advantage|Law of Association</text></strong> is the fundamental law of production: joint production yields greater return than isolated production, thus always drawing humans together</li>
<li>Commodities with intrinsic value became money for indirect exchange, allowing the division of labor to grow</li>
<li><strong>Money:</strong> a medium of exchange that is <em>generally accepted</em> in society.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>This acceptance comes by virtue of objective physical characteristics and has historically been dominated by the precious metals for their <em>scarcity, durability, divisibility, distinct look and sound, homogeneity through space and time, malleability, and beauty</em></li><br />
<li><strong>Indirect Exchange</strong> using a <strong>medium of exchange</strong> (money) extends the division of labor</li><br />
<li>A money commodity "must be desired for its nonmonetary services (for its own sake)". There must be an established price for the commodity arising from its nonmonetary use allowing for an assessment of the future price. Monetary use will increase the demand for the commodity and add a monetary component to the price.</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Natural Monies</strong> are monies freely chosen when property rights are respected<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Natural money is: 1) valuable <em>prior</em> to its monetary use, and 2) physically suitable as a medium of exchange</li><br />
<li>Property rights are fundamental, and the Christian tradition distinguishes between the <em>right</em> to own property and the <em>moral</em> obligation to make good use of it (cf. <em><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">2021-08-12-Summa Theologiae</text></em> IIa-IIae, q. lxvi, art. 2)</li><br />
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Silver</text> has been the most chosen natural money historically (for everyday payments), along with <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Gold</text> (for larger purchases) and copper (for very small transactions) (46, 61)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Credit Money</strong> is an IOU for a commodity, deriving its value from an expected future redemption into some commodity</li>
<li><strong>Paper Money</strong> is forced money without commodity value, and desired because it is 1) cheaper to produce, 2) easily inflated, and 3) simple to change units<br />
<ul><br />
<li>In no period of human history has paper money spontaneously emerged on the free market, and was not even considered a possibility before the eighteenth century</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Electronic Money</strong>: "no such money has been produced" (when written in 2008)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-money-certificates">Chapter 2: Money Certificates</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Coins are certificates integrated with money and produced by minters, providing ease (and value) beyond bullion. Paper notes redeemable for physical money are disconnected certificates and not typically adopted naturally because of the opportunity for abuse. Both forms of certificates are safeguarded by competition.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Certificate</strong>: A written testimony to the truth of any fact, or a written declaration legally authenticated.</li>
<li><em>Coins</em> are <strong>Certificates Physically Integrated with Money</strong>: precious metal with an imprint that certifies its weight<br />
<ul><br />
<li>The value depends on the trustworthiness of the certifier/minter, and a trustworthy coin adds value to the bullion weight</li><br />
<li>Minters could offer an insurance service to trade a used coin for a new one</li><br />
<li>Competition also helps secure the trustworthiness of minters</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><em>Paper notes redeemable for physical money</em> are <strong>Certificates Physically Disconnected from Money</strong> and feature:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><em>Intermediation</em> where a third party holds the money</li><br />
<li><em>Titles</em> (legal title) is provided to the bearer of the certificate for that amount of money</li><br />
<li><em>Reserves</em> of real money held</li><br />
<li>These provide the advantage of lower costs, but come at the expense of abuses (especially in the holding of reserves) which is virtually inevitable</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-3-money-within-the-market-process">Chapter 3: Money within the Market Process</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Production of money reduces is purchasing power, but this happens over time and unevenly (Cantillon effect). In a free market the production of money is part of the general division of labor and several monies circulate in parallel. Money production redistributes real income from later to earlier owners ("distribution effects"), which is often a source of conflict. Coins need to specify but not be identified by their weight to remove confusion. The use of money/banking is consistent with Christianity (cf. <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Mt-25#v26</text>-<text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Mt-25#v30</text>).</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Money production causes money prices to increase and its purchasing power to decrease<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Scarcity (especially of time) is the basic economic fact of human life</li><br />
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Law of Diminishing Marginal Value</text>: the relative importance of any unit of an economic good diminishes as we come to control a greater overall supply of the good (43)</li><br />
<li>These effects are spread out over time: the <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Cantillon effect</text></li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>In a free market, the production of money is part of the larger division of labor, and several monies circulate in parallel</li>
<li><strong>Distribution Effect</strong>: money production redistributes real income from later to earlier owners of the new money</li>
<li>Notes on <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Usury</text>, defined as "excessively high interest on money lent" (footnote 10 on 52)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-4-utilitarian-considerations-on-the-production-of-money">Chapter 4: Utilitarian Considerations on the Production of Money</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: ==He rebuts common arguments for paper money...==</em></p>

<ul>
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Plato</text> proposed outlawing natural money and imposing fiat money</li>
<li>The production of money is best left to the free market. Here are the 7 most common erroneous arguments presented against that proposition in favor of paper money:</li>
<li><strong>Money Supply</strong>: argue that economic growth is only possible with a growth of the money supply<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Any quantity of goods and services can be exchanged with virtually any natural monetary supply</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hoarding</strong>: argue that the amounts of money held relative to alternative ways of investing one's wealth is excessive (cf. hoarding quote from <em><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">2022-02-05-The Mandibles#^776a05</text></em>)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>"In times of stock market and real-estate booms, it is generally prudent to keep a large amount of one's wealth in cash." (63)</li><br />
<li>Hoarding is not a good reason to artificially expand the money supply - the market will correct this</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Deflation</text></strong>: argue that deflation causes people to postpone buying and creates a banking crisis (cf. <em><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">2021-12-01-The Price of Tomorrow</text></em>)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Historically deflation has had no negative impact on aggregate production</li><br />
<li>Deflation causes consumption to slow only marginally: resources not consumed are saved and therefore available for investment elsewhere (cf. <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Time preference</text>)</li><br />
<li>Deflation entails a redistribution of productive assets from old to new owners, but with a net zero impact on production (similar to how it impacts banks), and results in <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Creative destruction</text></li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sticky prices</strong>: argue that manipulating the money supply can reestablish equilibrium especially in the labor market<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Pure fallacy that supposes monetary policy makes can always outsmart labor unions</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cheap money</strong>: argue that paper money decreases the interest rate and promotes economic growth<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Investors seek a <em>real</em> return, not just a nominal return</li><br />
<li>Artificially low interest rates lure investors into investments that cannot be completed (cf. <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Lk-14#v28</text>)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Monetary stability</strong>: argue that paper money needed to maintain stable <em>purchasing power of money (<strong>PPM</strong>)</em><br />
<ul><br />
<li>Stability in purchasing power is arbitrary since different goods/services move with respect to each other, and tremendous power accrues to the person who controls the algorithm to define purchasing power (cf. <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">2021-05-24 Article-I’m Trying To Understand Hedonic Adjustments</text>)</li><br />
<li>Economic calculation does not require stable absolute PPM since it makes relative comparisons/decisions</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Costs of commodity money</strong>: argue that paper money costs much less to produce than natural money<br />
<ul><br />
<li>The costs of paper money need to include the whole system including the large bureaucracies of central banks and monetary authorities</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="part-2-inflation">Part 2: Inflation</h1>

<h2 id="chapter-5-general-considerations-on-inflation">Chapter 5: General Considerations on Inflation</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Inflation</text> is money produced through the violation of property rights.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Inflation is money produced beyond that demanded by the free market<br />
<ul><br />
<li>most people define it to mean the reduction in purchasing power of money</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Since the <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Free market</text> is social cooperation conditioned by the respect of private property rights, inflation extends the money supply through a violation of property rights</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-6-private-inflation-counterfeiting-money">Chapter 6: Private Inflation: Counterfeiting Money</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Counterfeiting can be accomplished through debasement (less metal in a coin than advertised) or fractional-reserve banking. These are never permissible except in a great emergency when the entire community gives its consent.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Governments have always played a larger role in debasement than private citizens</li>
<li>Fractional-reserve banking is effectively the counterfeiting of bank notes when the banker is not candid about the nature of their reserves</li>
<li>Counterfeiting is usually detected and stopped quickly in the free market because people are vigilant </li>
<li>The money-changers in <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Mt-25#v27</text>/<text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Lk-19#v23</text> were likely fractional-reserve bankers</li>
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Nicholas Oresme</text>: the function of <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Inflation</text> is to enrich the government at the expense of other people</li>
<li><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Ludwig von Mises</text>: <text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Inflation</text> contradicts the principal of popular sovereignty and the only way to keep the government in check is to control its resources</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-7-enter-the-state-fiat-inflation-through-legal-privileges">Chapter 7: Enter the State: Fiat Inflation through Legal Privileges</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Governments benefit with increased revenues through inflation, or "institutional usury". Fiat inflation causes fiat deflation of other monies.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fiat inflation</strong> is inflation caused beyond the normal level by governments, and governments are always the main beneficiaries of inflation</li>
<li><em>State theory of money:</em> government has the power to impose money on its citizens, through <strong>legal privileges</strong> granted to fiat monies (legalized falsifications, legal monopolies, legal tender laws, and legalized specialization of payments, dealt with in the next sections)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-8-legalized-falsifications">Chapter 8: Legalized Falsifications</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Legalizing falsifications of money (usually after the government has already debased the money) tends to not cause significant disruption because of the markets free ability to adjust (such as by hoarding the old, non-debased coins). However, legalized falsification is the foundation for all other monetary privileges such as legal tender laws.</em><br />
- The legalization of false certificates permanently increases the risk of being cheated in monetary exchanges.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-9-legal-monopolies">Chapter 9: Legal Monopolies</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Monopolies create inflation of the favored money and deflation of alternatives, and are especially problematic when paired with legal tender laws. Monopolies are condemned because they are against the 8th commandment and the freedom to associate.</em><br />
