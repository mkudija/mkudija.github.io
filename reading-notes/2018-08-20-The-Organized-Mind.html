<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h1 id="the-organized-mind-thinking-straight-in-the-age-of-information-overload-by-daniel-j-levitin"><em>The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload</em> by Daniel J. Levitin</h1>

<p><code>(New York: Penguin, 2014), 396</code></p>

<p><strong>Fundamental Principle of Organization</strong>: “shift the burden of organizing from our brains to the external world” (370)</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-history-of-cognitive-overload">Chapter 1 - History of Cognitive Overload</h2>

<ul>
<li>Paradox of choice (someone who lived in communist Romania and then moved to the US)</li>
<li>Highly Successful People have employees who filter things for them so they never need to worry about focusing on the right thing </li>
<li>We have strong filters (change, importance) that help us focus on what is important and ignore everything else </li>
<li>Switching attention comes with high costs; our brain is optimized to do one thing at a time </li>
<li>Active sorting: shift organization from your mind to the physical world (Gibsonian affordances)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-how-attention-and-memory-work">Chapter 2 - How Attention and Memory Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mind wandering mode (decentralized network) bs central executive mode </li>
<li>Four parts of attentional system: wandering, central executive, switching, filtering? </li>
<li>The central executive can be thought of as a series of lenses for zooming in and out on the appropriate category </li>
<li>Theoretically you can represent every known particle in the universe with your brain...crazy </li>
<li>Analog: prevalence of using tangible things to external use memory, such as notebook and pen </li>
<li>Index cards and systems for tasks: 2 minute rule, do no, delegate, defer, drop, etc </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-3-organizing-our-homes">Chapter 3 - Organizing our Homes</h2>

<ul>
<li>ACE hardware: items in functional categories but also located near similar items since they will likely be associated by your mind or the task at hand </li>
<li>Reading this (colored pants in department store for instance) makes me think about principles of visualization and how our minds categorize information. </li>
<li>To not lose things, have a designated place </li>
<li>Key point/strategy: use the environment to offload items out of your mind </li>
<li>How to organize your home:<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Define categories that are meaningful to you</li><br />
<li>Avoid putting too many different things in the same category, unless a misc item</li><br />
</ol></li>
<li>Organization rules:<br />
<ol><br />
<li>A mislabeled item is worse than a not labeled item</li><br />
<li>If there is an existing standard, use it</li><br />
<li>Don’t keep what you can’t use </li><br />
</ol></li>
<li>Digital home: Have a separate device (computer) dedicated to different activities, with different background, etc to make it recognizable </li>
<li>Declare “email bankruptcy” and delete/archive everything and start over </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-4-organizing-our-social-lives">Chapter 4 - Organizing our Social Lives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Recaptcha for OCR training </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-5-organizing-our-time">Chapter 5 - Organizing our Time</h2>

<ul>
<li>Negative genes that kick in after peak age of reproduction don’t have a means for natural selection to weed them out </li>
<li>Reasons why multi tasking doesn’t work </li>
<li>Prefrontal cortex for breaking a project into components and planning </li>
<li>Car wash example: split jobs with different attentional sets to reduce cognitive costs of switching </li>
<li>Sleep is important for consolidating memories and solving problems </li>
<li>Bi-modal sleep was the norm for most of our history and changed only with the invention of artificial light </li>
<li>He gives recommendations for helping your body adjust to travel across time zones </li>
<li>Eat the frog: do the worst task first thing in the day </li>
<li>Being outside in nature replenishes self-regulatory mechanisms in the brain</li>
<li>Successful people don’t subscribe to a faulty belief that life should be easy</li>
<li>To focus:<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Write everything you need to do down to get it off your mind</li><br />
<li>Take a break and exercise </li><br />
<li>5-minute rule for little tasks </li><br />
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-6-organizing-information-for-the-medical-decisions">Chapter 6 - Organizing Information for the Medical Decisions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Discussion of probabilities and common fallacies </li>
<li>Bayes: "Organizing our decisions requires that we combine the base rate information with other relevant diagnostic information" (229)...Base rates and representativeness hueristic </li>
<li>Applying Bayes to decisions about your medical treatment </li>
<li>Our brains easily notice co-occurrence of events, but not lack of occurrences </li>
<li>Parking ticket example:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Parking costs $20</li><br />
<li>Parking ticket costs $50, and there is a 25% chance you get a parking ticket</li><br />
<li>Therefore, the expected value of paying for parking is -$20, and the expected value of not paying for parking is 25% * -$50 = -$12.50. So you shouldn't pay for parking.</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fourfold (contingency tables)</strong>: allows us to calculate Bayesian probability models, for example "What is the probability that I have a disease, <em>given</em> that I already tested positive for it?"...example (page 231+ and appendix):</p>

<ul>
<li>You took a blood test that came back positive for the disease</li>
<li>The blood test is wrong 2% of the time (false positive and false negative)</li>
<li>The base rate of disease is 1 in 10,000 (0.0001)</li>
<li>Medication ends with unwanted side effect 5% (0.05) of the time</li>
<li>Should you take the medicine...?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is our four-fold table:</p>

<p>| | Test (Positive) | Test (Negative) |<br />
| --- | --- | --- |<br />
| Disease (Yes) | Correct ID | False Negative |<br />
| Disease (No) | False Positives | Correct rejections | </p>

<p>| | Test (Positive) | Test (Negative) | <strong>Totals</strong> |<br />
| --- | --- | --- | --- |<br />
| Disease (Yes) | 1 (1-0)| 0 (1 * 2%) | <strong>1</strong> |<br />
| Disease (No) | 200 (9,999 * 2%) | 9,799 (9,999-200) | <strong>9,999</strong> |<br />
| <strong>Totals</strong> | 201 | 9,799 | <strong>10,000</strong> | </p>

<p>Now, to answer our question: what is the probability I have the disease given that I tested positive?</p>

<p>Or, <em>p(You have the disease | You tested positive)</em> = 1/201 = 0.49%</p>

<p>Say we decide to take the test a second time (assuming that test results are independent):</p>

<p>| | Test (Positive) | Test (Negative) | <strong>Totals</strong> |<br />
| --- | --- | --- | --- |<br />
| Disease (Yes) | 1 (1-0)| 0 (1 * 2%) | <strong>1</strong> |<br />
| Disease (No) | 4 (200 * 2%) | 196 (200-4) | <strong>200</strong> |<br />
| <strong>Totals</strong> | 5 | 196 | <strong>201</strong> | </p>

<p><em>p(You have the disease | You tested positive twice)</em> = 1/5 = 20%</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7-organizing-the-business-world">Chapter 7 - Organizing the Business World</h2>
