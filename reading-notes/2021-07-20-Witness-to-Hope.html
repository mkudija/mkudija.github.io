<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fecx.images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F51QJmr6e4nL.<em>SY291</em>BO1%2C204%2C203%2C200<em>QL40</em>.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" width=150></p>

<p><code>(New York: HarperCollins, 1999), 960</code></p>

<p>I bought this back in June of 2015 when I was living in LA. I forget why I bought it then but it was perhaps after listening to <em>John Paul II: A Personal Portrait of the Pope and the Man</em> by Ray Flynn. Its great bulk sat on my shelf through three moves while I continued to read some other titles by John Paul II (<em>Rise, Let Us Be On Our Way</em>, <em><a href="2019-12-23-Centesimus-Annus.html">Centesimus Annus</a></em>, <em>Theology of the Body</em>, and <em>The Jeweler's Shop</em>) or about him (<em><a href="2019-03-10-Lead-Yourself-First.html">Lead Yourself First</a></em> by Raymond Kethledge, <em>John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father</em> by Peggy Noonan and <em>Saint John Paul the Great</em> by Jason Evert). Then at the end of May 2021—with high recommendation from <a href="../notes/Fr.-Dailey.html">Fr. Dailey</a>—I felt prompted to pick it up and dive in. What an adventure!</p>

<p>I spent 2018 through 2020 reading William Manchester's <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Last Lion.md">The Last Lion</a></em> trilogy on Churchill<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-churchill"><a href="#fn-churchill">1</a></sup>, and can now spend 2021 through 2023 reading Weigel's trilogy on John Paul II.</p>

<p>Reading biographies is perhaps the best way to learn history: you can best understand a person by understanding the world they inhabited. <em>Witness to Hope</em> is not only the story of John Paul II, but also a history of Poland's "double defeat" in World War II, the most lucid history of Vatican II and its implementation I have yet encountered, and a fascinating view into the workings of the Holy See.</p>

<p>Being an authorized biography, Weigel had impressive access to interview those close to Karol Wojtyła in Poland and John Paul II in Rome, as shown by the extensive notes to the volume. It's interesting that John Paul II chose Weigel, an American. There must be some bias associated with reading about John Paul II through an American lens, though of course this is the angle I'm most interested in as an American myself.</p>

<p>Karol Wojtyła was formed in the crucible of the two great evil regimes of the 20th century: Nazi fascism and Soviet communism. His perspective on suffering is born of personal experience and his call to "Be not afraid!" carries the moral authority of someone who has stood up to some of the worst evil the human heart has produced. And through his Carmelite spirituality, influenced by St. John of the Cross, he taught and lived the reality of the cross, that suffering is a central part of our human experience.</p>

<p>John Paul II is a great humanist, offering an integrated Christian anthropology to correct the twisted interpretations of the human person offered by modernity. To a world that so often reduces a person to a subject of state control, a consumer in a market economy, or an object of sexual pleasure, he proposes a view of the human person as a moral agent, created as man and woman in the image of God. And our true happiness and fulfillment as human persons is found ultimately in self-giving love.</p>

<p>Now that I am the father of a daughter, I am especially interested in the Christian feminism articulated by John Paul II, focused intensely on Mary as the Mother of the Church and echoing voices such as Edith Stein. This Christian <em>feminism</em> flows naturally from a Christian <em>humanism</em>. </p>

<p>John Paul II believed and taught the priority of <em>culture</em> in forming human societies and writing human history. Culture—not politics or economics—is the driving force of history. The truth of this position is seen in the survival of the Polish people despite the destruction of the Polish state, and has hopeful implications for our situation today: we may not be able to change political or social structures directly, but we most certainly can change the culture, starting with the most basic culture in our families.</p>

<p>Finally, John Paul II is a great inspirational figure. <em>Witness to Hope</em> shows how he inspired millions of people around the world—Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Some of the most holy priests I know point to him as a major figure in the discernment of their vocations. John Paul II has become an influential figure in my life, and <em>Witness to Hope</em> has been an adventure in getting to know him more.</p>

<li>The "hardest-fought battle between Church and regime involved family life...all organized by the state to separate parents from their children as frequently as possible" (97)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła's line: <strong>"You have to decide."</strong> --> he gently forced judgment and choices (105)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła believed the goal of <a href="../notes/Confession.html">Confession</a> was the sanctification of all life. The confessor is a "counselor in the practice of the virtues" (107)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła believed "<a href="../notes/Marriage.html">Marriage</a> is the beginning of our understanding of the interior life of God...the human experience that begins to make God comprehensible to human beings" (116)</li>
<li>Literature is a "supple instrument for delving into the hidden depths of the human condition" --> <em>The Power and the Glory</em> by Graham Greene and <em>The Plague</em> by Camus (117) </li>

<li>Resisting communism: Karol Wojtyła "was creating de facto networks of resistance to communism by helping to raise up a generation of Poles who could resist the communist culture of the lie with the truth of their religious and moral convictions" (120)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-4-seeing-things-as-they-are">Chapter 4: Seeing Things as They Are</h2>

<p><em>Wojtyła the Philosopher</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phenomenology</strong>: bring everyday things back into philosophy, see things whole and as they are, see <a href="../notes/Max-Scheler.html">Max Scheler</a>, <a href="../notes/Dietrich-von-Hildebrand.html">Dietrich von Hildebrand</a>, <a href="../notes/Edith-Stein.html">Edith Stein</a> (127)
<ul>
<li>cf. <em><a href="2020-11-18-After-Virtue.html">After Virtue</a></em> (128): "If the choice was not between good and evil, but only between personal preferences, then all choices were ultimately indifferent and the real choice no longer existed" --> removes human freedom (129)</li>
<li>synthesized the metaphysical realism of <a href="../notes/Aristotle.html">Aristotle</a> and <a href="../notes/St.-Thomas-Aquinas.html">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> with the human experience of <a href="../notes/Max-Scheler.html">Max Scheler</a> (128)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła constantly re-read the Gospel of <a href="../notes/John.html">John</a>, leading to his focus on people rather than texts (129-130)</li>
<li>Pursuit of <strong>philosophical anthropology</strong> at the KUL (Catholic University of Lublin) (132):
<ul>
<li>The root of our issues is a modern crisis in the understanding of the human person --> requires redirecting philosophy since the <a href="../notes/Enlightenment.html">Enlightenment</a></li>
<li>Seek to merge <em>metaphysics</em> (reality, things as they are), <em>anthropology</em> (nature and destiny of human person), and <em>ethics</em> (What ought we do?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Four principles that guided the KUL philosophers (133):
<ol>
<li>Be realistic about the world and the human capacity to know it. <em>"Human beings can only be free in the truth, and the measure of truth is reality."</em></li>
<li>Philosophy should being with a reflection on the human person and human experience.</li>
<li>Commitment to reason.</li>
<li>Ecumenism of time: the past is not disposable to modernity </li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>"Ideas have consequences, for good and for ill. The history of the twentieth century's various torments, proved that defective understandings of the human person, human community, and human destiny were responsible for mountains of corpses and oceans of blood."</strong> (134)</li>
<li><strong>The Law of the Gift</strong> was central to Karol Wojtyła's <strong>personalism</strong>: responsible self-giving, not self-assertion, was the road to human fulfillment (136)
<ul>
<li>see <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Love and Responsibility.md">~Love and Responsibility</a></em> (137)
<ul>
<li>our sexuality reveals our dependence on others (141)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Chastity.html">Chastity</a> is the integrity of love, the virtue that makes it possible to love the other as a person (142)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wojtyła quirks: he could weirdly multi-task, thinks (and writes) in circles rather than linearly (making him hard to read at times), and made a point of learning from his students (138)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-5-a-new-pentecost">Chapter 5: A New Pentecost</h2>

<p><em>Vatican II</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Gaudiem et Spes</em>: Karol Wojtyła's primary contribution to Vatican II
<ul>
<li>Working on <em>GS</em> began his special friendship with <a href="../notes/Henri-de-Lubac.html">Henri de Lubac</a></li>
<li>To Karol Wojtyła, <em>GS</em> 22 (Christian humanism) was the theological linchpin and <em>GS</em> 24 (Law of the Gift) was the philosophical and moral of the entire Council (169)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I hypothesize that Vatican II also created Pope John Paul II out of Karol Wojtyła by giving him exposure to his fellow bishops (169)</li>
<li>Wojtyła viewed Vatican II as a "personalist" council: intense focus on the human person (171)</li>
<li><em>Person and Act</em> is Wojtyła's public account of Vatican II's teaching on freedom and truth (172-3)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Living the Council in Kraków</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The communists naively pushed for Wojtyła's nomination as Archbishop of Kraków, and he proceeded to be a thorn in their side (184)</li>
<li>Bishop Wojtyła's approach to solving problems: (187-8)
<ul>
<li><em>What truth of faith sheds light on this problem?</em></li>
<li><em>Who can we get—or train—to help?</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bishop Wojtyła's <a href="../notes/Daily-Routine.html">Daily Routine</a>: wake at 5-5:30, 1 hour of private prayer, Mass, breakfast, 9-11 two hours of writing in front of the Blessed Sacrament, 11-1 visitors, lunch at 2 (188, 201)
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>Bishop Wojtyła pursued 7 priorities (188+): <strong>Religious Freedom</strong> (building churches and making a public display of Catholicism), the <strong>Seminary</strong> (a priest's holiness is the secret of pastoral success), <strong>Youth Ministry</strong>, <strong>Family Ministry</strong>, <strong>Dialogue with Intellectuals</strong>, <strong>Charity</strong></li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła's patron saint was Charles Borromeo (200)</li>
<li>Wojtyła implemented Vatican II with the Synod of Kraków
<ul>
<li>He formed 500 study groups to read the texts of Vatican II with Wojtyła's <em>Sources of Renewal</em> as a commentary (205)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Humanae Vitae</em> (206)
<ul>
<li>Wojtyła set up the Kraków commission, which published a memorandum on <em>HV</em>, which "offered a more compelling explanation of <em>why</em>" the same conclusions reached make sense, rather than the tone deaf final product of <em>HV</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Confession.html">Confession</a>: "When a man goes down on his knees in the confessional because he has sinned, at that very moment he adds to his own dignity as a man." (224)</li>
<li>Wojtyła was disturbed by the "insouciance in post-Vietnam American public live about the world situation, and the threats to the human hunger for freedom that were still being mounted by an aggressive atheistic ideology" (226)

<li><a href="../notes/Henri-de-Lubac.html">Henri de Lubac</a> observed the rise of "atheistic humanism" preaching a new worldview by the likes of Compte, Feuerbach, Marx, and Nietzsche (600)</li>

<li><em>Centesimus Annus</em> as an encyclical that dealt with economics from the bottom up rather than top down (612)
<ul>
<li>Pope Leo XIII (<em>Rerum Novarum</em>) and John Paul II both saw the collapse of <a href="../notes/Socialism.html">Socialism</a> as inevitable because of its fundamental error about the nature of the human person (614)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/Marxism.html">Marxism</a> held that only by exacerbating social conflicts was it possible to resolve them through violent confrontation (614)</li>

The danger was not all that difficult to imagine. If a democracy did not recognize such a transcendent moral standard, the only way to resolve conflict within it was the exercise of raw force by one faction (imposing its will through legislation or by more violent means) over another. The aggrieved faction, in turn, would regard the imposition of a solution as a violation of its basic rights. The net result would be the dissolution of the democratic political community.</strong> (618)</li>

<li><em>Ex Corde Ecclesiae</em> as correction of the way Catholic universities in the US "cut themselves loose form their intellectual moorings in the midst of a major cultural crisis" (cf.

<li>Against <a href="../notes/Scientism.html">Scientism</a>: "Science was not simply a matter of empirical facts.

<li><em>Redemptoris Missio</em>: the Church is missionary by her very nature (634)
<ul>
<li>"Christian mission is one form of obedience to the great commandment of love for one's neighbor...Christ has saved us, and our willingness to share his Gospel with others is an index of the degree to which we have truly understood and grasped the import of that." (635)</li>

<li>John Paul II's Christian <a href="../notes/Feminism.html">Feminism</a> anchored in the Bible and the Marian Church (852)</li>
<li>John Paul II remained a <a href="../notes/Carmelite.html">Carmelite</a> at heart: "The joy a Christian experiences from knowing christ's ultimate victory over evil intensifies one's awareness of evil's enduring power in the world. Life, and the daily papal duty of bringing the world's suffering before the Lord in prayer, had deepened his Carmelite intuition that all roads to the truth eventually wind their way to Calvary, to the cross. And Calvary was, and remains, a lonely place." (862)</li>
<li>Weigel makes the case that John Paul II is MacIntyre's "new St. Benedict" (cf. <a href="2020-11-18-After-Virtue.html">2020-11-18-After Virtue</a>, 863)
<ul>
<li><strong>"The antidote to despair amid the sundry madnesses of late modernity, the Pope had long proposed, was the experience of a community of self-giving love in which we learn the destiny that awaits us on the far side of loneliness—life within the community of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."</strong> (863)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If John Paul II becomes "John Paul the Great" it will be because he met the barbarian threat and proposed an alternative (863):

<li>Gregory the Great against the Lombards</li>
<li>John Paul II against the defective humanisms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>John Paul II resembled G. K. Chesterton's description of Thomas More: <strong>"he was above all things, historic: he represented at once a type, a turning-point, and an ultimate destiny.

<li>"Press coverage of the encyclical predictably stressed the Pope's reaffirmation of classic Catholic sexual morality, although in fact these issues were barely referenced in <em>Veritas Splendor</em>, it was not clear why reporters thought it newsworthy that the Pope continued to think that fornication was wrong."
