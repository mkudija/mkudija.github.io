<h1 id="witness-to-hope-the-biography-of-pope-john-paul-iihttpswwwamazoncomwitness-hope-biography-pope-johndp006018793x-by-george-weigel"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Hope-Biography-Pope-John/dp/006018793X"><em>Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II</em></a> by [[George Weigel]]</h1>

<p><code>(New York: HarperCollins, 1999), 960</code></p>

<p><code>Notes Started: 2021-07-20</code></p>

<p>I bought this off Amazon for $4 back in June of 2015 when I was living in LA. I forget why I bought it then but it was perhaps after listening to <em>John Paul II: A Personal Portrait of the Pope and the Man</em> by Ray Flynn. Its bulk sat on my shelf while I continued to read <em>Rise, Let Us Be On Our Way</em>, <em>[[2019-12-23-Centesimus Annus|Centesimus Annus]]</em>, <em>Theology of the Body</em>, and <em>The Jeweler&#8217;s Shop</em> by him, and <em>[[2019-03-10-Lead Yourself First|Lead Yourself First]]</em> by Raymond Kethledge, <em>John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father</em> by Peggy Noonan and <em>Saint John Paul the Great</em> by Jason Evert about him. Then at the end of May 2021—with high recommendation from [[Fr. Dailey]]—I felt prompted to pick it up and dive in. What an adventure!</p>

<p>The years 2018–2020 were for reading William Manchester&#8217;s <em>[[2018-07-11-Last Lion—Visions of Glory|The Last Lion]]</em> trilogy on Churchill<sup class="footnote-ref&#8221; id="fnref-churchill"><a href="#fn-churchill">1</a></sup>, and now the years 2021–2023 can be for reading Weigel&#8217;s John Paul II trilogy.</p>

<p>I love reading biographies because it is simultaneously the story of a person and the history of the world they inhabited. This here is not only the story of John Paul II, but also a history of Poland&#8217;s &#8220;double defeat&#8221; in World War II by the Nazi&#8217;s and subsequent Communist rule, the most lucid history of Vatican II and its implementation I have yet encountered, and a fascinating view into the workings of the Holy See. </p>

<p>Themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Christian humanism and anthropology as a response to the dangers of modernity</li>
<li>Speaking truth to power, the power of hope, and how there is no fear if we are rooted in Christ: &#8220;Be not afraid!&#8221; (66)</li>
<li>Always propose, never impose: &#8220;You must decide&#8221; (13, 105)</li>
<li>Priority of culture: history is driven by culture (7)</li>
<li>The crisis of the modern world is a crisis of <em>ideas</em>, and a crisis of the <em>idea of a human person</em> (7)</li>
<li>The drama of life: we are moral agents, and Christ is the center of the cosmic drama (8)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-the-law-of-the-gift-136">- The Law of the Gift (136)</h2>

<p>from Prologue (6-7)</p>

<ul>
<li>Against modernity&#8217;s pleasure seeking, he teaches that suffering is central and redemptive (34: redemptive suffering central to Polish self-understanding)</li>
<li>Against intellectual skepticism, he teaches that universal truths exist, are knowable, and impose moral duties (70)</li>
<li>Against plastic personality, he defends a universal human nature</li>
<li>Against a world that equates happiness with success, he teaches that happiness comes from obedient submission to truth and love</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-against-utility-he-focuses-on-inherent-human-dignity">- Against utility, he focuses on inherent human dignity</h2>

</details></p>

<h2 id="humorous">Humorous</h2>

<ul>
<li>Polish joke: &#8220;Should Poland be invaded simultaneously by Germans and Russians, the Polish army should shoot the Germans first, on the ancient principle of business before pleasure.&#8221; (21)</li>
<li>WWII is the war Poland lost twice (46)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-1-a-son-of-freedom">Chapter 1: A Son of Freedom</h2>

<p><em>Early life</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Battle of the Vistula</strong> (Miracle on the Vistula): August 1920 battle that saved Poland from the Soviets (17)</li>
<li>Poland was known for its religious toleration (19)</li>
<li>Mieszko was baptized Latin-rite Catholic in 966 (rather than Eastern) and anchored Poland in the West for 1000 years (20)</li>
<li>The Polish nation survived the destruction of the Polish state &#8211;> John Paul&#8217;s theme of culture (not politics or economics) being the driving force in history (22)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła&#8217;s father was the most influential figure to him: autodidact, a man of constant prayer, his example was a &#8220;domestic seminary&#8221; ([[2019-03-10-Lead Yourself First#^fbec9c]]) (29+)</li>
<li>[[Daily Routine]] as a boy: rose early, pray, 7 am mass, 8 am school, evening walk (31)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła received a [[Classical Education]]: Latin, Greek, Polish (32)</li>
<li>Dignity of [[Work]] in the works of Norwid: &#8220;Work accepted with love is the highest manifestation of human freedom and is thus redemptive&#8221; (35)</li>
<li>Drama: the actor and the priest both open up, through the materials of the world, the realm of transcendent truth (37)</li>
<li>&#8220;[[Fatherhood]] meant rejecting the prison of selfishness; fatherhood meant being conquered by love.&#8221; (42)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-from-the-underground">Chapter 2: From the Underground</h2>

<p><em>The Third Reich</em></p>

<ul>
<li>[[Spiritual Disciplines]]: confession on the first Friday of the month according to Catholic custom and Karol Wojtyła&#8217;s personal habit (45)</li>
<li>WWII formed John Paul II (46)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;The wars horrors and an unexpected encounter during the Occupation with a lay mystic began to shape Karol Wojtyła&#8217;s distinctively [[Carmelite]] spirituality, which focused on the cross as the center of the Christian life, and indeed the center of human history.&#8221; (46)</li><br />
<li>This was his experience of manual labor and <strong>cultural activism</strong>: the defense of national cultural identity as a means of political resistance and liberation (46)</li><br />
<li>Poland was the only nation where the Nazis failed to establish a collaborationist regime (48)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>[[Reading]]: Karol Wojtyła: &#8220;While others were dying of boredom I have surrounded myself with books, dug in with Arts and Sciences&#8221; (55). He also took the night shift since it was easier to read then (56).<br />
<ul><br />
<li><em>True Devotion to Mary</em> by St. Louis de Montfort (57)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>[[Work]] is a participation in God&#8217;s creativity (57), and &#8220;We work because we love—our families, our children&#8230;&#8221; (58)</li>
<li><strong>Jan Tyranowski</strong> (59+): self-taught, read broadly in Catholic spirituality, who acted as a lay leader to Karol Wojtyła and others after the Salesian fathers were rounded up by the Nazis<br />
<ul><br />
<li>&#8220;It&#8217;s not difficult to be a saint&#8221; &#8211;&gt; led him to regularize his spiritual life in a systematic fashion</li><br />
<li>weekly hour-long meetings to learn the spiritual life</li><br />
<li>his lay ministry demonstrated to Karol Wojtyła the universal call to holiness</li><br />
<li>he introduced Karol Wojtyła to [[St. John of the Cross]]: <em>Poetry</em>, then <em>The Ascent of mount Carmel</em>, <em>The Dark Night of the Soul</em>, <em>The Spiritual Canticle</em>, <em>The Living Flame of Love</em><br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>Karol Wojtyła learned Spanish to read him in the original</li><br /><br />
</ul></li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Rhapsodic Theater: proclaim truth against the violent lies of the Occupation, speak truth to power (cf. <em>[[2021-07-15-"Live Not by Lies"]]</em>) (66)</li>
<li>[[Realism]]: Reading <em>Metaphysics</em> by Kazimierz Wais convinced him (along with [[Aristotle]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]) that the world is intelligible (against the radical skepticism of the age) (70)</li>
<li>[[Fr. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, OP]] (master of traditional neo-scholasticism) directed Karol Wojtyła&#8217;s dissertation on [[St. John of the Cross]]&#8217;s understanding of faith (85)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>he also wrote <em>Predestination</em>, recommended by [[Fr. Raymund]] when I was struggling with Thomas&#8217; treatment of predestination while reading the <em>[[Summa Theologiae]]</em></li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-3-call-me-wujek">Chapter 3: &#8220;Call Me <em>Wujek</em>&#8221;</h2>

<p><em>Early priesthood</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The Polish Church &#8220;knew the transient nature of political regimes&#8221; (91)</li>
<li>[[Daily Routine]]: Karol Wojtyła worked 16-18 hour days (95)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła engaged students intellectually with <strong>Christian Humanism</strong> as a university chaplain to combat the militant atheist Marxism of the regime (95)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>He organized a group to read the <em>[[Summa Theologiae]]</em> in Latin (!)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>The &#8220;hardest-fought battle between Church and regime involved family life&#8230;all organized by the state to separate parents from their children as frequently as possible&#8221; (97)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła&#8217;s line: <strong>"You have to decide."</strong> &#8211;> he gently forced judgment and choices (105)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła believed the goal of [[Confession]] was the sanctification of all life. The confessor is a &#8220;counselor in the practice of the virtues&#8221; (107)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła believed &#8220;[[Marriage]] is the beginning of our understanding of the interior life of God&#8230;the human experience that begins to make God comprehensible to human beings&#8221; (116)</li>
<li>Literature is a &#8220;supple instrument for delving into the hidden depths of the human condition&#8221; &#8211;> <em>The Power and the Glory</em> by Graham Greene and <em>The Plague</em> by Camus (117) </li>
<li>Poverty: Karol Wojtyła never had a bank account or personal money (119)</li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła was &#8220;almost always late for meetings and appointments, having gotten himself absorbed in his previous engagement or his voracious and incessant [[Reading]]&#8221; (119)</li>
<li>Resisting communism: Karol Wojtyła &#8220;was creating de facto networks of resistance to communism by helping to raise up a generation of Poles who could resist the communist culture of the lie with the truth of their religious and moral convictions&#8221; (120)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-4-seeing-things-as-they-are">Chapter 4: Seeing Things as They Are</h2>

<p><em>Wojtyła the Philosopher</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phenomenology</strong>: bring everyday things back into philosophy, see things whole and as they are, see [[Max Scheler]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], [[Edith Stein]] (127)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>cf. <em>[[2020-11-18-After Virtue|After Virtue]]</em> (128): &#8220;If the choice was not between good and evil, but only between personal preferences, then all choices were ultimately indifferent and the real choice no longer existed&#8221; &#8211;&gt; removes human freedom (129)</li><br />
<li>synthesized the metaphsical realism of [[Aristotle]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] with the human experience of [[Max Scheler]] (128)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Karol Wojtyła constantly re-read the Gospel of [[John]], leading to his focus on people rather than texts (129-130)</li>
<li>Pursuit of <strong>philosophical anthropology</strong> at the KUL (Catholic University of Lublin) (132):<br />
<ul><br />
<li>The root of our issues is a modern crisis in the understanding of the human person &#8211;&gt; requires redirecting philosophy since the [[Enlightenment]]</li><br />
<li>Seek to merge <em>metaphysics</em> (reality, things as they are), <em>anthropology</em> (nature and destiny of human person), and <em>ethics</em> (What ought we do?)</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Four principles that guided the KUL philosophers (133):<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be realistic about the world and the human capacity to know it. <em>"Human beings can only be free in the truth, and the measure of truth is reality."</em></li><br />
<li>Philosophy should being with a reflection on the human person and human experience.</li><br />
<li>Commitment to reason.</li><br />
<li>Ecumenism of time: the past is not disposable to modernity </li><br />
</ol></li>
<li><strong>"Ideas have consequences, for good and for ill. The history of the twentieth century&#8217;s various torments, proved that defective understandings of the human person, human community, and human destiny were responsible for mountains of corpses and oceans of blood."</strong> (134)</li>
<li><strong>The Law of the Gift</strong> was central to Karol Wojtyła&#8217;s <strong>personalism</strong>: responsible self-giving, not self-assertion, was the road to human fulfillment (136)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>see <em>Love and Responsibility</em> (137)<br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>our sexuality reveals our dependence on others (141)</li><br /><br />
<li>[[Chastity]] is the integrity of love, the virtue that makes it possible to love the other as a person (142)</li><br /><br />
</ul></li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Wojtyła quirks: he could weirdly multi-task, thinks (and writes) in circles rather than linearly (making him hard to read at times), and made a point of learning from his students (138)</li>
