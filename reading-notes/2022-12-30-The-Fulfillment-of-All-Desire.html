<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes

Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos

<p><img src="https://stpaulcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/9781931018364.jpg" width=150></p>

<p><code>(Steubenville: Emmaus Road Publishing, 2005), 473</code></p>

<p>I read this over the second half of 2022 and it has helped and coincided with a deeper turn toward prayer and away from sin. <a href="../notes/Fr.-Mike-Schmitz.html">Fr. Mike Schmitz</a> said that he has listened to it six or seven times, because it reminds him of the point of everything and how the spiritual life is a lifelong journey.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-mike"><a href="#fn-mike">6</a></sup> </p>

<p>"The fulfillment of all desire" is union with God himself (xvii), and Martin beautifully weaves together the teaching of the mystical doctors of the Church on the topic: <a href="../notes/St.-Augustine.html">Augustine</a>, <a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, <a href="../notes/St.-Catherine-of-Siena.html">Catherine of Siena</a>, <a href="../notes/St.-John-of-the-Cross.html">John of the Cross</a>, <a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa of Avila</a>, <a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">St. Francis de Sales</a>, and <a href="../notes/St.-Thérèse-of-Lisieux.html">Thérèse of Lisieux</a>. In the introduction he tells of how he struggled many times to read John of the Cross, but then he read <em>The Spiritual Canticle</em> in the airport and it was "the right book at the right time" after previously struggling with John: "a certain amount of life experience was necessary before I could understand the truth and relevance of these works" (xv). I have struggled with Catherine, John, and Teresa, but this book made their teaching come alive and showed the beautiful consistency between the saints themselves along with Scripture and Tradition. </p>

<p>I am taking a few practical takeaways from my first reading of this book.</p>

<p><strong>First is the importance of focusing on God's will.</strong> I had not memorized the <em><a href="../notes/Our-Father.html">Pater Noster</a></em> yet when reading this, but <em>fiat voluntas tua</em> has become a favorite phrase and prayer:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I give you one counsel; that you don't think that through your own strength or efforts you can arrive, for reaching this stage is beyond our power; if you try to reach it, the devotion you have will grow cold. But with simplicity and humility, which will achieve everything, say: <em><strong>fiat voluntas tua</strong> (your will be done).</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-fiat"><a href="#fn-fiat">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Second is the importance of the resolution to never offend God</strong> as a turning point on the spiritual journey. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you firmly resolved never to commit [mortal sin] for any reason whatsoever?...In this resolution consists the foundation of the spiritual life.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-resolve"><a href="#fn-resolve">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Third is the importance of giving God our firstfruits</strong>, especially of our time in prayer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perform these exercises confidently, as I have marked them out for you, and God will give you sufficient leisure and strength to perform all your other duties.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-firstfruits"><a href="#fn-firstfruits">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fourth is how our neighbors (i.e. family) are often the means of our sanctification.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your neighbors are the channel through which all your virtues are tested and come to birth, just as the evil give birth to all their vices through their neighbors.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-neighbor"><a href="#fn-neighbor">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, I have been easily discouraged when reading about the spiritual life (for instance in <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Collected Works of Saint John of the Cross.md">~The Collected Works of Saint John of the Cross</a></em> by <a href="../notes/St.-John-of-the-Cross.html">John of the Cross</a>) to realize how little I have traveled and how far I have yet to go. Yet the saints (and this book) are encouraging. They remind us that while our effort is important, we are dependent primarily upon the <strong>free gift of God's grace, for which we have only to ask</strong> (197):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.<br />
  –<a href="../notes/Mt-07.html">Mt-07</a> (RSVCE)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is particularly relevant to a discussion of the spiritual life, for the fulfillment of all desire is union with God and Christ says these words right before telling us about the narrow gate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.<br />
  –<a href="../notes/Mt-07.html">Mt-07</a> (RSVCE)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernard says it well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever is lacking in my own resources I appropriate for myself from the heart of the Lord, which overflows with mercy.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-bmercy"><a href="#fn-bmercy">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary: </p>

<ol>
<li>Focus on God's will: <em>fiat voluntas tua</em></li>
<li>Resolve to never offend God</li>
<li>Give God our firstfruits, especially the firstfruits of our time </li>
<li>We are sanctified especially through our neighbors (family)</li>
<li>The primacy of Grace, and we must only ask</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>He read <em>The Spiritual Canticle</em> by <a href="../notes/St.-John-of-the-Cross.html">St. John of the Cross</a> in the airport and it was "the right book at the right time" after previously struggling with John: "a certain amount of life experience was necessary before I could understand the truth and relevance of these works" (xv)</li>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Novo Millennio Ineunte.md">Novo Millennio Ineunte</a></em> called for the whole church to reconnect with the mystical tradition </li>
<li><strong>The fulfillment of all desire is union with God</strong> (xvii)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-1-called-to-holiness">Chapter 1: Called to Holiness</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We are all called to holiness, and we need to choose now!</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus summed up his teaching as: "You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect." (<a href="../notes/Mt-05.html">Mt-05</a>)
<ul>
<li>This is a universal call to holiness (cf. <a href="../notes/John-Paul-II.html">John Paul II</a>, <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Novo Millennio Ineunte.md">Novo Millennio Ineunte</a></em>)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa of Avila</a>: Holiness is bringing our wills into union with God's will </li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/John-Paul-II.html">John Paul II</a>'s four principles of the mystical tradition (<em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Novo Millennio Ineunte.md">Novo Millennio Ineunte</a></em>)
<ol>
<li>We are totally dependent on God's grace, but with him all things are possible</li>
<li>Our effort is indispensable to dispose us to receive God's grace </li>
<li>Much has to change to make us capable of deep union with God (dark nights, tribulations)</li>
<li>All the effort and pain is infinitely worth it!</li>
</ol></li>
<li>"What really holds us back from a wholehearted response to the call of Jesus is the interior sluggishness of our hearts. We need to be clear that there will never be a better time or a better set of circumstances than now to respond wholeheartedly to the call to holiness." (7)</li>
<li>A flavor of <a href="../notes/Pascal's-wager.html">Pascal's wager</a>: "If we aim for purgatory and miss, there really isn't a good backup available." (7)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-an-overview-of-the-journey">Chapter 2: An Overview of the Journey</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: The <strong>Purgative</strong> stage includes the initial phases of the spiritual life; the <strong>Illuminative</strong> stage is one of continuing growth; the <strong>Unitive</strong> stage is one of deep, habitual union with God. All three can be present in the same person.</em></p>

<li><strong>Spirituality for Lay People: The "Devout Life"</strong>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Philothea; Or an Introduction to the Devout Life.md">Introduction to the Devout Life</a></em>: a "devout" life is ordered towards holiness, which consists in a heart transformed in love and justice </li>
<li>True devotion must touch every area of our life, and is characterized by both love of God and love of neighbor </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The First Purgation: Mortal Sin</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: "Are you firmly resolved never to commit [mortal sin] for any reason whatsoever?...In this resolution consists the foundation of the spiritual life." (108, cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Philothea; Or an Introduction to the Devout Life.md">Introduction</a></em>)</li>
<li>Make a general confession if returning, then weekly <a href="../notes/confession.html">confession</a>, and be as specific as possible: "It is an abuse to confess any kind of sin, whether mortal or venial, without a will to be rid of it since confession was instituted for no other purpose." (109-109, cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Philothea; Or an Introduction to the Devout Life.md">Introduction</a></em>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Second Purgation: The Affection for Sin</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nurturing affection for sin, abstaining regretfully from sin, speaking with petulance: these slow us down in the spiritual life and dispose us to future falls; this creates a divided heart and makes the spiritual life wearisome </li>
<li>"The saints have a wonderful way of bringing the insight of Scripture into contact with the circumstances of our lives." (111)</li>
<li>"We need to determine, with the help of God's grace, never to freely choose to offend him." (112)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Venial Sin</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a> on <a href="../notes/Parenting.html">Parenting</a>: "Nor, under the guise of administering correction, should you dare to pierce with sharp and searing words one for whom Christ was pleased to be crucified." (114)</li>
<li>Inadvertent venial sin and fault is not a big deal, as long as we immediately reject them and refuse to entertain affection for them</li>
<li>"Hatred for sin is important. Confidence in the mercy of God is even more important." (114)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Thérèse-of-Lisieux.html">Thérèse</a>: "The more one advances, the more one sees the goal is still far off" (115)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-7-the-importance-of-prayer">Chapter 7: The Importance of Prayer</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Remember that the goal of our strivings is nothing else but relationship with God, and we must give him the firstfruits of our time in prayer.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-John-of-the-Cross.html">John</a>: our sensual attractions are so strong that a greater love has to inflame us to let go of lesser, disordered loves (119)</li>
<li>The spiritual life is primarily a <em>relationship</em>, which requires time, attention, and care: <a href="../notes/Prayer.html">Prayer</a> is simply paying attention to God (121)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: "Since prayer places our intellect in the brilliance of God's light and exposes our will to the warmth of his heavenly love, nothing else so effectively purifies our intellect of ignorance and our will of depraved affections...I especially counsel you to practice <a href="../notes/Mental-Prayer.html">Mental Prayer</a>, the prayer of the heart, and particularly that which centers on the life and passion of our Lord." (121)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: Pronounce "the words of the Holy Spirit with becoming manliness and resonance and affection; and correctly, what while you chant you ponder on nothing but what you chant." (123)</li>
<li><strong>Methods of <a href="../notes/Prayer.html">Prayer</a></strong> (<a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a> suggests six steps for <a href="../notes/Mental-Prayer.html">Mental Prayer</a>):
<ol>
<li>Place yourself in the presence of God</li>
<li>Ask the Lord to help you </li>
<li>Pick a passage from Scripture or spiritual reading </li>
<li>Think about what you've chosen to meditate on</li>
<li>Yield to good affections </li>
<li>Come to practical resolutions: "virtues meditated on but not practiced sometimes inflate our minds and courage"</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Give priority to <a href="../notes/Mental-Prayer.html">Mental Prayer</a>: "Don't be concerned at not finishing the vocal prayers you intended to say. The mental prayer you substitute for them is more pleasing to God and more profitable for your soul." (125) </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Simplicity of Prayer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Speak memorized prayers slowly and from the heart </li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a> reminds us that it is about the <em>relationship</em>: "<a href="../notes/Mental-Prayer.html">Mental Prayer</a> in my opinion is nothing else than an intimate sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with Him who we know loves us." (127)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/John-Paul-II.html">John Paul II</a>: "All harm comes to us from not keeping our eyes fixed on You." (129)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Time and Place</strong>
<ul>
<li>"We cannot pray 'at all times' if we do not pray at specific times, consciously willing it." (131, cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Catechism of the Catholic Church.md">CCC</a></em> 2697)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: "Set aside an hour every day before the mid-day meal, if possible early in the morning when your mind is less distracted and fresher after the night's rest." (132)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prayerfulness throughout the Day</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>' advises <a href="../notes/Spiritual-Disciplines.html">Spiritual Disciplines</a> (134):
<ul>
<li>Turn to the Lord as soon as you wake</li>
<li>Spent substantial time in personal prayer early in the morning if possible </li>
<li>Attend daily Mass as often as possible </li>
<li>Pray the <a href="../notes/Liturgy-of-the-Hours.html">Liturgy of the Hours</a></li>
<li>Withdraw into the cell of our souls periodically throughout the day</li>
<li>Perform an examination of conscience before the evening meal</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Give God the firstfruits of our time: <strong>"Perform these exercises confidently, as I have marked them out for you, and God will give you sufficient leisure and strength to perform all your other duties."</strong> (135)</li>
<li>Say short prayers throughout the day; <a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a> recommends the name of Jesus: "Write what you will, I shall not relish it unless it tells of Jesus...<strong>Jesus to me is honey in the mouth, music in the ear, a song in the heart.</strong>" (136)</li>

<h2 id="chapter-8-temptations-and-trials">Chapter 8: Temptations and Trials</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Encountering temptations and trials is a necessary condition for making progress.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Common Temptations in the Early Stages of the Journey</strong>
<ul>
<li>Immature Zeal
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: the devil takes advantage of the pride and vanity that coexists with genuine fervor to tempt to imprudence or excess </li>
<li>Points to the importance of seeking out wise and balance <a href="../notes/Spiritual-Direction.html">spiritual counsel</a> </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Misplaced Priorities 
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: a certain reordering of our priorities is necessary fi we are to make progress: we should eliminate the nonessentials and make room for ordering our life to God</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is God Fair?
<ul>
<li>Instead of comparing ourselves to others (ahead or behind us spiritually), we need to look at all of reality in the light of eternity (142)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: "You have bid a great, general farewell to the world's follies and vanities and this may bring on a feeling of sadness and discouragement." (144)</li>
<li>"<a href="../notes/St.-John-of-the-Cross.html">John</a> speaks so often of persevering in the darkness of faith as the most valuable and proximate means of union with God." (144)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: "Don't seek feelings of consolations in prayer. Seek the Lord, seek to conform your will to His!" (145)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="../notes/St.-Thérèse-of-Lisieux.html">Thérèse</a>'s Little Way: Daily Self-Denial in the Service of Love</strong>
<ul>
<li>Waiting Purifies: God frequently made Thérèse wait as a means to help overcome her self-will (146)</li>
<li>Daily Self-Denial: pray to Thérèse for patience and humility in family life</li>
<li>Don't Waste Any Opportunity: "strew flowers" for the Lord</li>
<li>Loving with His Love: <strong>"Charity consists in bearing with the faults of others, in not being surprised at their weakness, in being edified by the smallest acts of virtue we see them practice...It is no longer a question of loving one's neighbor as oneself but of loving him as <em>He, Jesus, has loved him</em>"</strong> (151, on <a href="../notes/Parenting.html">Parenting</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dealing with Temptation</strong>
<ul>
<li>We need to reject temptation and the desire to sin immediately (155)</li>
<li>God is delighted when we resist temptations </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Resisting Temptations: A Means to Growth</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Resisting temptations and enduring trials is one of the primary means of spiritual growth...The very attacks intended to defeat us in fact become the means to victory if we apply the wisdom of the saints in dealing with them." (159)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How Long Will the Purification Last?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Temptation: More Helpful Advice</strong>
<ul>
<li>Resist the small temptations as well as the big ones </li>
<li>Perform some contrary act of virtue </li>
<li>Bring temptation to a spiritual director </li>
<li>Just say no!</li>
<li>Run to the cross of Christ and ask for help </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Positive Power of Trials: Dryness of Prayer</strong></li>
<li><strong>What's the Cause of the Dryness We Experience?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lukewarmness and Infidelity, <a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: "You have glutted yourself with worldly pleasures and it is no wonder that spiritual delights disgust you" → repentance is the only solution (165)</li>
<li>Fatigue and Illness: "you can never suffer for his sake anything equal to what he has suffered for you." (170)</li>
<li>Dark Night: God is purposely removing the experience of His presence so as to give us an opportunity to mature in faith, hop, and love (170)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advice for Discerning the Cause of the Dryness</strong>
<ul>
<li>In a dark night permitted by God, we are not able to find consolation in things less than God...if the concern to serve and please God persists in the midst of the difficulty it is a sign of God's purifying work (172-173)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Dark Night as an Important Means of Growth</strong>
<ul>
<li>Times of dryness are very important times of growth: don't give up, but remain faithful (174)</li>

<h2 id="chapter-9-a-certain-stability">Chapter 9: A Certain Stability</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: A lack of knowledge and a lack of desire are the two main obstacles preventing our progress—but ask for them and we shall receive.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Knowledge</strong>
<ul>
<li>Self-knowledge and knowledge of God are both essential for making progress </li>
<li>"Self-knowledge involves both knowledge of the great dignity and beauty of the human soul in its exalted destiny as well as a profound understanding of the wounds and darkness that sin inflicts on it." (184)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: "While we are on this earth nothing is more important to us than <a href="../notes/humility.html">humility</a>...In my opinion we shall never completely know ourselves if we don't strive to know God. By <a href="../notes/Eucharistic-Adoration.html">gazing</a> at His grandeur, we get in touch with our own lowliness; by looking at His purity, we shall see our own filth; by pondering His humility, we shall see how far we are from being humble." (187, cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Interior Castle.md">The Interior Castle</a></em>)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: "If you lack self-knowledge you will possess neither the fear of God nor humility." (188)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Progress Is Both Possible and Necessary</strong>
<ul>
<li>A lack of knowledge concerning how much progress is possible and how necessary it is holds many people back from the spiritual journey (190)</li>
<li>Holiness begins in the fear of the Lord and ends in a love without fear (190)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of Desire</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>"When we lack something essential for the spiritual journey then we are to ask for it, and it will be given."</strong> (197)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>God Will Draw Us: The Work of the Holy Spirit on the Spiritual Journey</strong>
<ul>
<li>"In order to make room for more of God in our life, we need to let go of things that are currently filling our heart and reorder the things that are not ordered properly in Him." (203)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-10-growing-in-freedom">Chapter 10: Growing in Freedom</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We need to let go—grow in detachment—in order to love more.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Money and Possessions</strong>
<ul>
<li>"It is neither the presence nor the absence of things that indicate true detachment, but rather, the interior freedom of heart that puts its trust not in things but rather in the Father's care." (209)
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: "To the man of faith the whole world is a treasure-house of riches: the whole world, because all things, whether adverse or favorable, are of service to him; they all contribute to his good." </li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../notes/Pascal's-wager.html">Pascal's wager</a> is effectively: "believe in God because there are asymmetrical consequences of being wrong."
<ul>
<li>A variation of this: "believe in God because whether he exists or not it makes you joyful through the suffering."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Practical Advice on Detachment</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: "If you find your heart very desolated and afflicted at the loss of property, believe me, you love it too much."</li>
<li>Therefore, if you have losses, this is the time to practice poverty and submit to them </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sensual Pleasure</strong>
<ul>
<li>Don't allow disordered pursuit of sensual pleasure be and obstacle to the greatest pleasure: union with God </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sexual Pleasure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Practical Advice on Chastity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Advice of the saints: (1) be clear about the truth; (2) ask God's help to live in accordance with it; (3) exercise practical wisdom in dealing with sexual temptation (217)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: "Be very quick to turn away from whatever leads or alludes to lewd conduct...Such things are always easier to avoid than to cure." (217)</li>
<li>The devil magnifies the delight and pleasure of imagined sex to tempt us with curiosity, which is the first step toward pride </li>
<li>"<a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a> acknowledges that this is challenging and that complete abstinence may in fact be easier to accomplish than an appropriate exercise of sexuality within marriage." (220)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pride</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: "<a href="../notes/Pride.html">Pride</a> is the beginning of all sin" (221, cf. <a href="../notes/Sir-10.html">Sir-10</a>); salvation cannot happen without pride being broken</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a> reminds us that even are merits are a result of grace: "whatever you impute to merit you steal from grace" (226)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Faith and Works</strong>
<ul>
<li>"The test of the genuineness of our faith is how we live our lives." (227)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Augustine.html">Augustine</a>: "Law was given so that we might seek grace and grace was given so that we might observe the law." (228)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: "The Lawgiver was not unaware that the burden of the law exceeded the powers of men, but he judged it useful for this reason to advise men of their own insufficiency, that they might know the proper end toward which they ought to strive according to their powers. <strong>Therefore in commanding impossible things he made men humble</strong>, not prevaricators, so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world be made subject to God, because nobody will be justified in his sight by the works of the law (<a href="../notes/Rom-03.html">Rom-03</a>-20). Accepting that command then, and conscious of our deficiency, we shall cry to heaven and God will have mercy on us (<a href="../notes/1-Mc-04.html">1 Mc-04</a>). And on that day we shall know that God has saved us, not by the righteous works that we ourselves have done, but according to his mercy (<a href="../notes/Ti-03.html">Ti-03</a>)."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growing in Virtue</strong>
<ul>
<li>Detachment is not an end in itself but prepares us for something greater </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="../notes/Humility.html">Humility</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>Love our weaknesses and accept the necessity of humiliations as a means to growing in humility </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Our Reputation</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is far better to ignore injuries or calumnies than to respond </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Our Health</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: the more we pamper and comfort our bodies the more pampering and <a href="../notes/comfortable.html">comfort</a> we will think we need</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: "learn how to suffer a little for the love of God without having everyone know about it!" (239, cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Collected Works of St Teresa of Avila (Volume 2).md">~The Collected Works of St Teresa of Avila (Volume 2)</a></em>)</li>
<li>Being overly concerned for our comfort and health is a serious obstacle to making progress in the spiritual life (241)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Patience</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Pride and lack of detachment can often manifest itself in impatience." (242)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Catherine-of-Siena.html">Catherine</a>: <strong>"Your neighbors are the channel through which all your virtues are tested and come to birth, just as the evil give birth to all their vices through their neighbors."</strong> (244)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Obedience</strong>
<ul>
<li>Obedience to a <a href="../notes/Spiritual-Direction.html">spiritual direction</a> can be a kick in the pants (248)</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Three Stages of Growing in Love</strong>
<ol>
<li>Embrace the Lord's feet as we turn away from sin </li>
<li>The wounded side of Christ, where we grasp more but are still mercenary in our love </li>
<li>The mouth of Christ, where are we united with Christ in the "kiss of the mouth": our love has no self-interest</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Love of Neighbor</strong>
<ul>
<li>"He who does not love remains in death." (<a href="../notes/1-Jn-03.html">1 Jn-03</a>)</li>

<li>God to <a href="../notes/St.-Catherine-of-Siena.html">Catherine</a>: "I wanted to make you dependent on one another so that each of you would be my minister." (260)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gratuitous Love</strong>
<ul>
<li>Virtue is intrinsically bound up with our relationships with our neighbors (261)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How to Tell If Our Love Is Selfish</strong>
<ul>
<li>...when we are distressed if they don't love us in return, or as much </li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a> on <a href="../notes/can-women-and-men-be-"just-friends"?.html">can women and men be "just friends"?</a>: "To be always in a woman's company without having carnal knowledge of her—is this not a greater miracle than raising the dead?" (265)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Value of Godly <a href="../notes/Friendship.html">Friendship</a>s</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a> on <a href="../notes/Spiritual-Direction.html">Spiritual Direction</a>: "Do you seriously wish to travel the road to devotion? If so, look for a good man to guide and lead you. This is the most important of all words of advice." (265)</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: "Take from the Church the honorable estate of marriage and the purity of the marriage bed, and you will surely fill it with concubinage, incest, masturbation, effeminacy, homosexuality—in short, with every kind of filthiness."

<h2 id="chapter-12-growing-in-prayer">Chapter 12: Growing in Prayer</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: Growing in prayer in another aspect of growing in love. It is our direct, focused time communing with God.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Meditation and Prayer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meditation: reflecting on the scriptures or spiritual reading; thinking about God </li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: even imperfect prayer changes us, we just need to consistently show up</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recollection</strong>
<ul>
<li>Recollection: the calming of our soul when we can just be in the presence of the Lord </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Infused Prayer (Contemplation)</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Contemplative prayer is a communication with God that isn't simply our own mental or affective effort, but has at least some dimension of 'givenness' by God." (289-290)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Prayer of Quiet</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a> received understanding of Latin: "And in fact, it has happened to me that while in this quietude, and understanding hardly anything of the Latin prayers, especially of the psalter, I have not only understood how to render the Latin verse in the vernacular but have gone beyond to rejoicing in the meaning of the verse." (291)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consolations in Prayer: Invitations to Go Deeper</strong>
<ul>
<li>Contemplative prayer is a call from the Lord, not a stopping point </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Lord's Visits</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Thérèse-of-Lisieux.html">Thérèse</a>: great understanding comes primarily not through study but through poverty of spirit; "Jesus has no need of books or teachers to instruct souls." (295)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Prayer of Union</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: In union, "the will loves more than it understands" (297)</li>
<li>Prayer is not primarily about technique, but about growing in relationship </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Union of Wills</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Although we can't always be sure if we're loving God more perfectly we can be sure whether we're loving our neighbor. And the surest way to love our neighbor, Teresa advises, is...to take advantage of the little, everyday opportunities that present themselves" (300-301)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Teresa-of-Ávila.html">Teresa</a>: "If we fail in love of neighbor we are lost" (302)</li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: "Whatever is lacking in my own resources I appropriate for myself from the heart of the Lord, which overflows with mercy." (304)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-13-help-from-heaven">Chapter 13: Help from Heaven</h2>

<p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We need to do our part, but God surely sends us tender "divine touches" of his love.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Solitude</strong>
<ul>
<li>Greater solitude can consist of eliminating nonessentials and focusing on increased prayer and spiritual reading </li>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Bernard-of-Clairvaux.html">Bernard</a>: "You must withdraw yourself mentally rather than physically...You enjoy this <a href="../notes/solitude.html">solitude</a> if you refuse to share in the common gossip, if you shun involvement in the problems of the hour and set no store by the fancies that attract the masses; if you reject what everybody covets, avoid disputes, make light of losses, and pay no heed to injuries" (307)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wounds of Love</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/St.-Francis-de-Sales.html">Francis</a>: we will know the value of our prayer by its fruit; do they make us more humble and patient? If so then they come from God (310)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Works from God</strong>

<li>Exterior works</li>
<li>Successive locutions</li>
<li>Formal locutions</li>
<li>Substantial locutions </li>
