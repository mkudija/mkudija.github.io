Helms (Editor), Robert J. Edmonson (Translator)</h1>

<p>(Brewster, MA: Paraclete, 2010), 127 (originally published 1693)</p>

<h2 id="fourth-conversation">Fourth Conversation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pray always: “It is a great error to believe that fixed prayer times are different from any other time, for we are as strictly obliged to be united to God through our duties in their appropriate time as by prayer in its time.“ (46)</li>
<li>“We must not grow weary of doing little things for the love of God” (46)</li>
<li>“All things are possible to one who believes; even more to one who hopes; still more to one who loves; and even more to one who perseveres in the practice of these three virtues.” (47)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-letter">First Letter</h2>

<ul>
<li>His prayer: “My God, here am I; I am entirely Yours; Lord, do with me according to Your heart.” (52)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="second-letter">Second letter</h2>

<ul>
<li>“If I were a preacher, I would not preach anything else than the practice of the presence of God” (56)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fifth-letter">Fifth letter</h2>

<ul>
<li>“I have left off all devotions and prayers that are not required for me, and I occupy myself solely with keeping myself in God’s holy presence. I do this simply by keeping my attention on God and by being generally and lovingly aware of Him. This could be called practicing the presence of God moment by moment, or to put it better, a silent, secret, and nearly unbroken conversation of the souls with God.” (63)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ninth-letter">Ninth letter</h2>

<ul>
<li>“One must be acquainted with a person before loving him. To be acquainted with God, one must think often about Him; and when we do love Him, we will also think very often about Him, for our heart is wheee our treasure is.” (74)</li>
</ul>

<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->
