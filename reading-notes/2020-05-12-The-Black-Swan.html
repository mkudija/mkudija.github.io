<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h3 id="anecdotes-life-lessons">Anecdotes &amp; Life Lessons</h3>

<ul>
<li>"You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just to show that you can walk the walk." (7)</li>
<li>Don't read newspapers or watch TV (17)</li>
<li>"The Good Life" for him is "f<em>*</em> you money" enabling this: "So I stayed in the quant and trading businesses (I'm still here), but organized myself to do minimal but intense (and entertaining) work, focus only on the most technical aspects, never attend business 'meetings', avoid the company of 'achievers' and people in suits who don't read books, and take a sabbatical year for every three on average to fill up gaps in my scientific and philosophical culture." (21)</li>
<li><strong>Erudition</strong>: "Erudition is important to me. It signals genuine intellectual curiosity. It accompanies an open mind and the desire to probe the ideas of others. Above all, an erudite can be dissatisfied with his own knowledge, and such dissatisfaction is a wonderful shield against Platonicity, the simplifications of the five-minute manager, or the philistinism of the overspecialized scholar." (48)</li>
<li>"heoroes focus on process rather than results" (89)</li>
<li>Business psychology insight (98)</li>

<ul>
<li>read a weekly magazine over daily news (144)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"the ultimate test of whether you like an author is if you've reread him" (198)</li>
<li>An ad homenin attack against an intellectual, not against an idea, is highly flattering. It indicates that the person does not have anything intelligent to say about your message. (280)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="funny">Funny</h3>

<ul>
<li>The business world is "inelegant, dull, pompous, greedy, unintellectual, selfish, and boring" (17)</li>
<li>"Scientists may be in the business of laughing at their predecessors, but owing to an array of human mental dispositions, few realize that someone will laugh at their beliefs in the (disappointingly near) future." (39)</li>
<li>"Looking busy can help you claim responsibility for the results in a random environment" (143)</li>
<li>"Being an executive does not require very developed frontal lobes, but rather a combination of charisma, a capacity to sustain boredom, and the ability to shallowly perform on harrying schedules." (166)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Black Swans are (xxii):
<ul>
<li>rare</li>
<li>have extreme impact</li>
<li>are predictable only in retrospect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Free markets work because they allow people to be <em>lucky</em>—tinker as much as possible and try to collect Black Swan opportunities (xxv)</li>

</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Type 1 randomness</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Extremistan</strong>: inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the total (social measurements wealth, book sales, etc.)

<ul>
<li>Avoid the narrative fallacy by favoring experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories (84)</li>

<li>a) as humans we need to summarize information, and b) more random is more difficult to summarize: <em>"the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is"</em> (69)
<ul>
<li>"Myths impart order to the disorder of human perception and the perceived 'chaos of human experience'"</li>
</ul></li>
