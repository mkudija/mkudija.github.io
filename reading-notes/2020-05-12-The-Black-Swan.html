<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>"You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just to show that you can walk the walk." (7)</li>
<li>Don't read newspapers or watch TV (17)</li>
<li>"The Good Life" for him is "f<em>*</em> you money" enabling this: "So I stayed in the quant and trading businesses (I'm still here), but organized myself to do minimal but intense (and entertaining) work, focus only on the most technical aspects, never attend business 'meetings', avoid the company of 'achievers' and people in suits who don't read books, and take a sabbatical year for every three on average to fill up gaps in my scientific and philosophical culture." (21)</li>
<li><strong>Erudition</strong>: "Erudition is important to me. It signals genuine intellectual curiosity. It accompanies an open mind and the desire to probe the ideas of others. Above all, an erudite can be dissatisfied with his own knowledge, and such dissatisfaction is a wonderful shield against Platonicity, the simplifications of the five-minute manager, or the philistinism of the overspecialized scholar."

<li>"the ultimate test of whether you like an author is if you've reread him" (198)</li>
<li>An ad homenin attack against an intellectual, not against an idea, is highly flattering. It indicates that the person does not have anything intelligent to say about your message. (280)</li>

<li>"Looking busy can help you claim responsibility for the results in a random environment" (143)</li>
<li>"Being an executive does not require very developed frontal lobes, but rather a combination of charisma, a capacity to sustain boredom, and the ability to shallowly perform on harrying schedules." (166)</li>

<h2 id="part-one-umberto-ecos-antilibrary-or-how-we-seek-validation">Part One: Umberto Eco's Antilibrary, or How We Seek Validation</h2>

<ul>
<li>The antilibrary:  
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/do-i-own-too-many-books/">The Japanese call this practice tsundoku, and it may provide lasting benefits - Big Think</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with "Wow! Signore <em>professore dottore</em> Eco, what a library you have! How many of these books have you read?" and the others—a very small minority—who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. <strong>Read books are far less valuable than unread ones.</strong> The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allow you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older; and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an <strong><em>antilibrary</em></strong>. </p>
  
  <p>We tend to treat our knowledge as personal property to be protected and defended. It is an ornament that allows us to rise in the pecking order. So this tendency to offend Eco's library sensibility by focusing on the known is a human bias that extends to our mental operations. People don't walk around with anti-résumés telling you what they have not studied or experienced (it's the job of their competitors to do that), but it Would be nice if they did. Just as we need to stand library logic on its head, We will work on standing knowledge itself on its head.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-1-the-apprenticeship-of-an-empirical-skeptic">Chapter 1: The Apprenticeship of an Empirical Skeptic</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Triplet of Opacity</strong> (issues with our minds coming up against history, 8):
<ul>
<li><em>illusion of understanding</em></li>
<li><em>retrospective distortion</em></li>
<li><em>the overvaluation of factual information, i.e. "Platonification"</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>history unfolds in bursts (like Thomas Kuhn says about scientific revolutions, 11), and isn't predictable</li>
<li>"Both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge" seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data" (20)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-2-yevgenias-black-swan">Chapter 2: Yevgenia's Black Swan</h3>

<ul>
<li>fictional story about a book that unexpectedly took off</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-3-the-speculator-and-the-prostitute">Chapter 3: The Speculator and the Prostitute</h3>

<ul>
<li>"To be genuenely empirical is to reflect reality as faithfully as possible" (27)</li>
<li>Scalable profession advice led him to <strong>the problem of induction</strong>: aka the turkey problem; technical name for the Black Swan
<ul>
<li>a scalable profession is good only if you are successful: few win and a lot lose</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mediocristan</strong>: when your sample is large, no single instance will significantly change the total (physical measurements like body size, etc.)
<ul>
<li>Type 1 randomness</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Extremistan</strong>: inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the total (social measurements wealth, book sales, etc.)
<ul>
<li>Type 2 randomness</li>
<li>this is where Black Swans occur</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-4-one-thousand-and-one-days-or-how-not-to-be-a-sucker">Chapter 4: One Thousand and One Days, or How Not to Be a Sucker</h3>

<ul>
<li>The turkey illustrates the danger of predicting the future from past data: it was fine for 1000 days until it got its head chopped off (41)</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-5-confirmation-shmonfirmation">Chapter 5: Confirmation Shmonfirmation!</h3>

<li>form a bold conjecture, and look for what would prove you wrong</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="chapter-6-the-narrative-fallacy">Chapter 6: The Narrative Fallacy</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Narrative fallacy</em>: our need to fit a story to a series of events
<ul>
<li>Avoid the narrative fallacy by favoring experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories (84)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a) as humans we need to summarize information, and b) more random is more difficult to summarize: <em>"the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is"</em> (69)
<ul>
<li>"Myths impart order to the disorder of human perception and the perceived 'chaos of human experience'"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kahneman &amp; Tversky: most of our mistakes in reasoning (and missing Black Swans) come from using System 1 when we think we are using System 2 (81-82)
<ul>
<li><em>System 1</em>: heuristics and biases</li>
<li><em>System 2</em>: thinking</li>

<ul>
<li>Also don't read self-help books written by winners that neglect all the failures</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>"be suspicious of the 'because' and handle it with care—particularly in situations where you suspect silent evidence"</em> (121)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-11-how-to-look-for-bird-poop-cosmic-microwave-background">Chapter 11: How to Look for Bird Poop (cosmic microwave background)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Popper's argument: to predict historical events you need to predict technological innovation which is impossible (171)
<ul>
<li><em>to understand the future to the point of being able to predict it, you need to incorporate elements from this future itself</em> (172)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"You can think rigorously, but you cannot use numbers." (179)</li>
