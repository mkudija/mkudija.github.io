<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p>Before the contents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.<br />
  —John F. Kennedy <em>on Theodore Roosevelt, New York City, December 5, 1961</em></p>

<p>The Preamble (which ends on page 39) is marvelous. It is worth reading this if nothing else. It gives you a sense of Churchill's life, his importance, and the beauty of his language. Manchester begins by outlining the dire straights England was in at the beginning of the Second World War and who would be needed to help, only to allude to Churchill in a magnificient way: "In London there was such a man." (4)</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

<p>"If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground." (6, to the War Cabinet)</p>

<p>"It was the nation and the race dwelling all round the globe that had the lion's heart; I had the luck to be called upon to give the roar." (7, on his 80th birthday)</p>

<p>"If you cannot read all your books, at any rate handle, or, as it were, fondle them—peer into them, let them fall open where they will, read from the first sentence that arrests the eye, set them back on their shelves with your own hands, arrange them on your own plan so that if you do not know what is in them, you will at least know where they are. Let them be your friends; let them at any rate be your acquaintances." (31)</p>

<p>Brevity: "This paper, by its very length, defends itself against being read." (31)</p>

<p>Finding himself naked before FDR: "The Prime Minister of Great Britain has nothing to hide from the President of the United States." (34)</p>
