<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

  <p>At that we moved ahead. The first step<br />
  was of clear white marble, so polished<br />
  that my image was reflected in true likeness.<br />
  The second was darker than the deepest purple,<br />
  of unhewn stone, looking as if it had been burned,<br />
  cracked through its length and breadth.<br />
  The third, resting its heavy mass above,<br />
  seemed to me porphyry, as flaming red<br />

<p>Dante says a lot that is consistent with the Church's teaching, but we can't always take him at face value: Hollander notes that "we should not be surprised to find that this poet remakes any text or any doctrine to his own liking and for his own reasons" (201).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our Father, who are in Heaven,<br />
  circumscribed only by the greater love<br />
  you have for your first works on high,</p>
  
  <p>praised be your name and power<br />
  by every creature, as is fitting<br />
  to render thanks for your sweet breath.</p>
  
  <p>May the peace of your kingdom come to us,<br />
  for we cannot attain it of ourselves<br />
  if it come not, for all our striving.</p>
  
  <p>As your angels make sacrifice to you<br />
  of their free wills, singing <em>hosanna</em>,<br />
  so let men make an offering of theirs.</p>
  
  <p>Give us this day the daily manna<br />
  without which he who labors to advance goes backward through this bitter wilderness.</p>
  
  <p>And, as we forgive those who have wronged us,<br />
  do you forgive us in your loving kindness—<br />
  measure us not as we deserve.</p>
  
  <p>Do not put to proof our powers,<br />
  which yield so lightly to the ancient foe,<br />
  but deliver us from him who tempts them.</p>
