<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><code>(New York: Doubleday, 1750, 1975), 119</code></p>

<p><a href="../notes/Fr.-Raymund.html">Fr. Raymund</a> mentioned this the first time we had him over and then again and the guy's night I went to, and I have enjoyed reading it slowly and allowing it to be a point of prayer in my day. This reminds me a lot of <em><a href="2018-08-26-The-Practice-of-the-Presence-of-God.html">The Practice of the Presence of God</a></em>, and is a wonderful daily devotional also like <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Imitation of Christ.md">The Imitation of Christ</a></em>. Abandonment is such a simple concept, and so full of meaning to unpack.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li>"True mystics are always much more practical than the ordinary run of people." (20)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i-on-doing-our-part-and-leaving-the-rest-to-god">I. On doing our part and leaving the rest to God.</h2>

<h4 id="1-the-holiness-of-the-old-testament-saints-and-indeed-that-of-st-joseph-and-the-blessed-virgin-came-through-their-obedience-to-gods-will">(1) The holiness of the Old Testament saints, and indeed that of St. Joseph and the Blessed Virgin, came through their obedience to God's will.</h4>

<h4 id="2-the-duties-of-each-moment-are-shadows-which-hide-the-action-of-the-divine-will">(2) The duties of each moment are shadows which hide the action of the divine will.</h4>

<ul>
<li>"the sacrament of the moment" (24)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-how-easy-it-is-to-be-holy">(3) How easy it is to be holy.</h4>

<ul>
<li>"holiness consists of one thing only: complete loyalty to God's will" (24)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-to-become-perfect-we-need-not-understand-the-designs-of-god-but-only-obey-them">(4)★ To become perfect, we need not understand the designs of God, but only obey them.</h4>

<ul>
<li>"Holiness is produced in us by the will of God and our acceptance of it. It is not produced by intellectual speculation about it...The desire to know more about it will only drive it further away." (27)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-the-reading-of-good-books-and-any-other-pious-exercises-are-useless-unless-they-are-the-channels-through-which-god-operates">(5) The reading of good books and any other pious exercises are useless unless they are the channels through which God operates.</h4>

<ul>
<li>"All our learning should consist of finding out what God has planned for us at each moment. Anything we read which is not chosen for us by God is harmful." (27)</li>
<li>"...the will of God is now manifesting itself in those circumstances which are the duty of the present moment. It is the fulfilling of this duty, no matter in what guise it presents itself, which does most to make one holy." (28)</li>
<li>real productivity: "All our moments are made productive by our obedience to the will of God, which reveals itself in a thousand different ways, each of which successively becomes our immediate duty." (28)</li>

<ul>
<li>"If you are not satisfied with what God chooses for you, what else can please you?" (31)</li>
<li>Just because it is "good" doesn't mean it is God's will: "If books, the example of the saints and discussions about spiritual matters, do nothing but disturb our peace of mind, and if we feel satiated but unsatisfied by them, it is a sure sign that we have not truly abandoned ourselves to God's will, and we are occupying with these things out of self-love...In reality, nothing benefits us that does not arise from God's will, and there is absolutely nothing that gives us more peace or does more to make us holy than obeying the will of God."

What is required from each soul is complete abandonment to this activity.</h4>

<ul>
<li>"So I shall no longer try to find you within the narrow limits of a book, in the life of a saint, or in some high-flown philosophy. All these are only drops of that ocean which flows over us all. God's activity moves through everything, and all else are but mere fragments which disappear within it." (54)</li>
<li>"You give me...a chisel to shape my human form into one worthy of heaven." (54)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="12-only-gods-activity-can-make-us-holy-for-it-alone-can-make-us-imitate-the-perfection-of-our-lord">(12) Only God's activity can make us holy, for it alone can make us imitate the perfection of our Lord.</h4>

<ul>
<li>"We are astonished by and glorify God's activities when we read about them, yet when he wishes to continue writing about them on our hearts we become restive and prevent him from doing so by our curiosity to see what he is doing in and around us." (57)</li>
</ul>
