<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>Difficult to acquire tenants

<h2 id="chapter-5-the-true-value-of-real-estate">Chapter 5 - The True Value of Real Estate</h2>

<ul>
<li>Residential: Return = Income / Price; Income and price are both market-determined values</li>
<li>Commercial: Property Value = Income / cap rate
<ul>
<li>Two ways to increase property value are to increase income (ch 8) or decrease cap rate</li>
<li>If you can double the income, you can double the value of the property</li>
<li>Think like this: "The property is being offered with a return of 11% in a market where prevailing cap rates are 10%"</li>
<li>cap rates are entirely determined by the market; return is determined by how well you buy</li>
</ul></li>
