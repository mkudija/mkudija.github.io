<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>Everything you can imagine is real. -Pablo Picasso</li>
<li>"True instruction is this: -to learn to wish that each thing should come to pass as it does."  -The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, XXIV</li>
<li>"You must know that it is no easy thing for a principle to become a man's own, unless each day he maintain it and hear it maintained, as well as work it out in life."  -The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, XXX</li>
<li>"Not death or pain is to be feared, but the fear of death or pain. Well said the poet therefore - 'Death has not terror; only a Death of shame!'"    -The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, LV</li>
<li>"Reflect that the chief source of all evils to Man, and of baseness and cowardice, is not death, but the fear of death.  Against this fear then, I pray you, harden yourself; to this let all your reasonings, your exercises, your reading tend.  Then shall you know that thus alone are men set free.'"  -The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, CXXXV</li>
<li>Addictions - LXXV</li>
<li>Humility - LXXIX</li>
<li>XCIX - To what extent should we associate only with those who are moral or share our values, opinions, beliefs etc. vs. associating and discussing with many people, including many of those who do not share our beliefs?  What is the proper balance between strengthening our character by surrounding ourselves with others similar to our selves or similar to what we desire to be vs. being open to other of differing character/belief in order to either defend our own beliefs or further our search for truth?</li>
<li>"If you seek Truth, you will not seek to gain a victory by every possible means; and when you have found Truth, you need not fear being defeated.'"  -The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, CXLIX</li>
<li>CLI - Giving thanks to God.</li>
<li>CLXXI - Humility in speaking of your accomplishments.</li>
<li>"When you have decided that a thing ought to be done, and are doing it, never shun being seen doing it, even though the multitude should be likely to judge the matter amiss.  For if you are not acting rightly, shun the act itself; if rightly, however, why fear misplaced censure?'"  -The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, CLXXII</li>
<li>"Think of God more often than thou breathest." -The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, Appendix A, XIX</li>
</ul>
