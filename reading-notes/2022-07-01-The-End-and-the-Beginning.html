<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320469900l/7939034.jpg" width=150></p>

<p><code>(New Work: Doubleday, 2010), 517</code></p>

<p>I spent 2018 through 2020 reading William Manchester's <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Last Lion.md">The Last Lion</a></em> trilogy on Churchill, and am now for 2021 through 2023 reading Weigel's trilogy on John Paul II. The first installment, <em><a href="2021-07-20-Witness-to-Hope.html">Witness to Hope</a></em> was an epic journey. This second installment, <em>The End and the Beginning</em>, starts with a recap of Karol Wojtyła's life to date. But the primary focus is on the buildup to the Great Jubilee of 2000 and his last years, as well as a comprehensive look at the accomplishments and frustrations of his pontificate.</p>

<p>Weigel emphasizes the same themes of John Paul's pontificate: especially the "law of the gift" (48, 355), how the church proposes but never imposes (437), and the Christian humanism he so consistently preached (517). </p>

<p>Sitting here in 2022, there are many lessons we can draw from his life. The teachings of the Church are perennial and timeless. John Paul preached these unchanging truths in a way that addressed the particular challenges of his (and still our) time. Interpreting and implementing Vatican II is a massive work that John Paul II focused much of his energy on, but that work is not complete. We are the generation charged with implementing Vatican II<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-vatican2"><a href="#fn-vatican2">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p>John Paul II also warns Europe about the consequences of abandoning its Christian roots (334). At stake is our entire culture, including especially the Christian tradition of human rights. Events since his death make this warning all the more important and all the more general: the challenge is certainly not isolated to Europe. </p>

<p>Finally, John Paul II always said that "You must decide!" (42, 412). And so it is with us: we must decide how to respond to Christ's call in our lives for this is "the same yesterday, today, and forever" (cf <a href="../notes/Heb-13.html">Heb-13</a>). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The understanding of the third millennium as a privileged moment of grace in which the Church could reexperience itself as a communion of disciples called to a new evangelization of the world; the personalist Christology according to which Jesus Christ reveals both the face of the merciful Father and the truth about our humanity; the notion of a Law of the Gift, built into the structure of moral choice and action, as the royal road to human fulfillment; solidarity as the key to living freedom nobly in free and virtuous societies; the revelatory iconography of our embodied ness and complementarity as male and female—these signature themes of the pontificate reflected a uniquely Wojtylan synthesis of Catholic thought and practice, and a crucial set of keys for interpreting the event at which the twentieth-century Catholic renewal reached its dramatic watershed, the Second Vatican Council.</p>
