2018-02-11


# Introduction
1. Everyone should have a side hustle (income diversity gives you more options)
2. It's not hard to start a side hustle
3. To be successful, you need to be able to generate profitable ideas and pick the best one
4. Side hustles are all about action! 

What you need:
- The right frame of mind
- The willingness to act

What you don't need:
- A lot of money
- A lot of time
- A business degree or other specialized education
- Employees
- Experience starting a business

# Week 1: Get Ideas

## Day 1: Predict the Future
What is the goal that drives your desire for a side hustle? 

## Day 2: Learn how money grows on trees
Your idea must:
- Be Feasible
- Be Profitable
- Be Persuasive

## Day 3: Brainstorm, borrow, or steal ideas
Brainstorm ideas from these basic categories:
- Sell a product
- Offer a service
- Be a middleman

Starter ideas: finite and not scalable (sell your stuff: eventually you'll run out of stuff to sell)
Next Level Ideas (NLI): scalable (buy other people's stuff and sell for profit)

## Day 4: Weight the obstacles and opportunities of each idea
Identify *constraints* and *oppurtunities*

## Day Forecast your profit on the back of a napkin
Use a simple forecast: **Profit = Revenue - Expenses**

Sensitivity: choose a best, worst, and expected case

# Week 2: Select Your Best Idea

## Day 6: Use the side hustle selector to compare ideas
Rank your ideas on these qualities:
- Feasibility
- Profitability
- Persuasiion
- Efficiency (how quickly can it be executed)
- Motivation (how excited are you?)

## Day 7: Become a detective
Look at what other people are doing and do it better or differently

## Day 8: Have imaginary coffee with your ideal customer
Create a specific avatar of your imaginary ideal customer and think about how you serve them

## Day 9: Transform your idea into an offer
An offer has a **promise** (benefit they will receive), a **pitch** (everything they need to know and nothing more), and a **price** (and call to action)

## Day 10: Create your origins story
Don't just give facts, tell them a story. "I've always been frustrated with <fill_in_the_blank> and I knew there was a better say. I made<fill_in_the_blank>." or "I've always been interested in <fill_in_the_blank> so I decided to try <fill_in_the_blank>". 

# Week 3: Prepare for Launch

## Day 11: Assemble the nuts and bolts
Resourcefulness is your most valuable skill as a side hustler.

5. Be fast with invoicing: get paid quickly

2. Consider pricing tiers
3. Don't stray from market prices

- Create a Facebook page before a website
- Launch in Beta first

## Day 18: Sell like a Girl Scout
Remember, the people who need your product want to hear from you

## Day 19: Ask ten people for help
Ask your contacts for a single actionable thing they can do to help

## Day 20: Test, test, and test again
You don't know what will be most effective so try different things and record the results (basic A/B testing)

## Day 21: Burn down the furniture store
Use promotions to help! Use the psychology of scarcity and urgency to your advantage.
1. Announce in advance
2. Don't make them jump through a bunch of hoops

Track what matters and ignore what doesn't. What matters:
- Profit
- Growth
- Time (your time spent on the project)

## Day 24: Grow what works, let go of what doesn't
Audit your side hustle occasionally:
- What working and how can I develop that further?
- What could I automate or outsource
- What could I do to make more money without spending more time?
- Could I increase prices?

## Day 25: Look for money lying under a rock
An easy way to grow is horizontal expansion

## Day 26: Get is out of your head
Systemetize where you can, write down workflows and processes
