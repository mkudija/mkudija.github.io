# Reading Notes

I have been recording notes on what I read since 2010, with irregular fidelity varying levels of details. 

- Many books that I read as hard copies have notes and underlines in the book itself. These are trascribed with verying levels of completeness.
- Books I read in college are likely not represented or under-represented, since these notes are contained in my Notre Dame Summary.
- Books I read as eBooks often have quotations directly copied electronically and may not have detailed page numbers.
- Books I listened to as Audiobooks likely are missing detailed citation information (page number).
