## Key Concepts:
- 

**Books**
- ***Human Action: The Scholar's Edition*** by Ludwig von Mises (3, 27, 37, 39, etc.)
- *Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls* by Schuettinger and Butler (26)
- *Gold Wars* by Ferdinand Lips (27)
- 


## Chapter 1: Money
*Summary: Money is a medium of exchange and store of value. Historically, harder money (high stock-to-flow) has produced more stable and prosperous societies.*

- problem of money: how to move value across time and space (1)
- direct exchange (barter) challenge due to scale, location, and time frame —> indirect exchange  (2)
- money (medium of exchange) differs from an investment: no return, lowest risk, no transaction cost (3)
- key characteristic of money is *salability* (ease of sale) according to Carl Menger (father of Austrian school of economics, *On the Origins of Money”) (3-4)
- money is:
  - medium of exchange (3)
  - store of value (4), determined by hardness and acceptability (7) and unit of account (denomination of prices) (8)
- *hardness* (difficulty in producing new monetary units) needed to preserve value over time (5)
  - *stock*: existing supply 
  - *flow*: production 
- inflation is **”expropriating the wealth of the savers”** (5)
- types of money are always competing with each other and higher stock-to-flow has won historically (6)
- single medium of exchange allows for economic growth and sophisticated production (8-9)


## Chapter 2: Primitive Moneys
*Summary: The story of Rai stones illustrate how walking away from hard money causes wealth to erode and even the fabric of society to fall apart.*

- Example of Rai stones on Yap Island
  - large imported limestone discs with high stock-to-flow, ownership known by everyone
  - David O'Keefe started importing them creating a drop in stock-to-flow and devaluation and conflict
- similar to aggry beads in western Africa, seashells, and cattle
  - European import of beads devalued them and resulted in impoverishment of locals through transfer of wealth to producers (14)
- easy money doesn't make society richer, but poorer by placing hard-earned wealth for sale in exchange for something too easy to produce (16)  


## Chapter 3: Monetary Metals
*Summary: Gold is sound money (high stock-to-flow) which is needed for flourishing society. Rome's fall is largely the story of a devalued currency, while the return to solid gold currency helped crate flourishing Renaissance city-states. The modern (19th century) gold standard was not perfect but sustained a prosperous and free society—hard money wins and soft money loses.*

### Why Gold?
- *market demand* (holding for its own sake) vs *monetary demand* (holding for exchange or to store value) example  and bubbles (19-21):
  - increased (monetary) demand causes a rise in prices
  - rise in price drives further demand
  - continually rising prices incentivize increased production, increasing supply
  - increased supply brings prices down
  - as a result: everyone who bought at a price higher than the usual market price loses, meanwhile producers of the asset benefit
- **gold** beats this trap and has won through history (21)
  - chemically stable and virtually impossible to destroy
  - impossible to synthesize (low supply)
- "Human civilization flourished in times and places where sound money was widely adopted, while unsound money all to frequently coincided with civilizational decline and societal collapse." (25)

### Roman Golden Age and Decline
- Rome's story (25-27):
  - stable monetary supply with the silver *denarius* coin
  - peasants moved to Rome to live better for free on the dime of prosperous emperors buying popularity
  - Nero started devaluing the currency (similar to Keynes after WWI), providing temporary relief but starting a vicious cycle
  - von Mises: by trying to manage their economies the emperors only made matters worse (27)
  - urbanites then fled Rome to get land and attempt self-sufficiency while not paying taxes
  - taxation and inflation destroyed the wealth and savings of Europe, turning Roman citizens into feudal serfs (29)

### Byzantium and the Bezant
- the lengthy and proud history of the Byzantine *solidus* coin:
  - first minted by Docletian in 301
  - changed name to *bezant* and Islamic *dinar*
  - continues to circulate today

### The Renaissance
- city-states pulled Europe out of the Dark Ages into the Renaissance, helped by the sound money standard started with Florence's *florin*
- silver and gold were complementary metals: silver for smaller transactions and gold for long-term storage of value and large payments (30)
- "The history of China and India, and their failure to catch up to the West during the twentieth century, is inextricably linked to this massive destruction of wealth and capital brought about by the demonetization of the monetary metal [silver] these countries utilized...History shows it is not possible to insulate yourself from the consequences of others holding money that is harder than yours." (33-34)
- Gold solved problems of salability across scales, space, and time by centralization, and therefore lost individual sovereignty and resistance to government control (34)

### La Belle Époque
- End of Franco-Prussian War in 1871 led to near worldwide gold standard and a golden age of human flourishing (34) with a very free society (36), lasting until WWI (37)
- gold standard was the best, but not perfect: bank notes and currency reserves made it vulnerable to a run on gold (37), and tended toward centralization and government control (38)
- key points (38):
  - **"Wealth can't be generated by tampering with the money supply"**
  - **"Allowing a sovereign the control of the money can only lead to them increasing their control of everyone's life"**
  - **"Civilized human living itself rests on the integrity of money providing a solid foundation for trade and capital accumulation"**


## Chapter 4: Government Money
*Summary: A brief sketch of government money history: Off the gold standard in WWI, a reason to focus on that over WWII as a turning point; Interwar years saw mismanagement of the Depression by Hoover and FDR and the rise of Keynesian government spending; WWII ends with the planned economy of Bretton Woods, and Nixon finally ends gold convertibility in 1971; Fiat money in the 20th century was not "sound" by Mises' definition due to government control, but Bitcoin is resistant to government control.*

## Chapter 5: Money and Time Preference
*Summary: **Time Preference** (discount rate) is how we value the present compared to the future. It is positive for us all (the present is more certain), but lower time preference leads to investment and increases productivity. Time preference determines our choices, and is greatly influenced by the expected future value of money. Deflationary fiat money leads directly to debt an lack of savings, and eventually to moral and family breakdown as a high time preference mentality pervades all aspects of our thinking. Modern art and architecture also exhibit the cultural decadence that results from soft money and high time preference.*

### Saving and Capital Accumulation

### Innovations: "Zero to One" Versus "One to Many"

### Artistic Flourishing


## Chapter 6: Capitalism's Information System
*Summary: **Prices** are the fundamental information system in a capitalist system, organizing the economy in a decentralized manner and allowing trade and specialization. Socialist systems fail by centrally planning prices, but this is the unfortunate situation caused in modern capital markets by central banks setting interest rates. Scarcity is fundamental, and recessions are the inevitable outcome of interest rate manipulation. Unsound money creates these business cycles, as well as the currency wars and massive drag on global output caused by foreign exchange markets.*

### Capital Market Socialism

### Business Cycles and Financial Crises

### Sound Basis for Trade


## Chapter 7: Sound Monetary and Individual Freedom
*Summary: The modern economic consensus is that a government central bank should expand the money supply in a controlled way. **Keynesians** focus on government spending, and **Monetarists** (Milton Friedman) focus on tax cuts. Both want to expand the money supply to discourage saving and investment and encourage consumption, the result being higher time preference in all areas of life. Contrast this with the **Austrian School**: **sound money** requires the absence of government control, and is a prerequisite for a peaceful society and honest governments.*

### Unsound Money and Perpetual War

### Limited versus Omnipotent Government

### The Bezzle


## Chapter 8: Digital Money
*Summary: **Bitcoin** is the first digital money: it does not require trusting a third party and is a digital asset that is verifyably scarce. A decentralized peer-to-peer network and proof-of-work are components of the technology that enables this.*

### Bitcoin as Digital Cash

### Supply, Value, and Transactions

### Appendix to Chapter 8


## Chapter 9: What Is Bitcoin Good For?
*Summary: Given scalable resources, the truly most valuable (and limited) resource is human time. The great accomplishment of Bitcoin is creating a commodity whose supply is strictly limited, making it an excellent store of value. Bitcoin offers a means to opt out of the modern state (cf. The Sovereign Individual) and promotes a brand of peaceful anarchism. Bitcoin can become the means for settling international transactions and it could possibly become a global reserve currency.*
