## Ch 1 Money
- problem of money: how to move value across time and space (1)
- direct exchange (barter) challenge due to scale, location, and time frame —> indirect exchange  (2)
- money (medium of exchange) differs from an investment: no return, lowest risk, no transaction cost (3)
- key characteristic of money is *salability* (ease of sale) according to Carl Menger (father of Austrian school of economics, *On the Origins of Money”) (3-4)
- money is:
  - medium of exchange (3)
  - store of value (4), determined by hardness and acceptability (7) and unit of account (denomination of prices) (8)
- *hardness* (difficulty in producing new monetary units) needed to preserve value over time (5)
  - *stock*: existing supply 
  - *flow*: production 
- inflation is **”expropriating the wealth of the savers”** (5)
- types of money are always competing with each other and and higher stock-to-flow has won historically (6)
- single medium of exchange allows for economic growth and sophisticated production (8-9)
