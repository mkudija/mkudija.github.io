# Chapter 1 - What is Commercial Real Estate
- **Residential** where people live
- **Commercial** where commerce is conducted

# Chapter 2 - People vs. Contracts

# Chapter 3 - Why Invest in Commercail Real Estate?
- Lease duration
  - benefit to you for planning and certainty
  - most tenants want long leases: 
    - *goodwill* associated with location
    - tenant investment in the property
- Assignment of Lease
  - you can pursue former tenant for rent if substitute does not pay
- Tenants Pay the Outgoings
  - triple net (NNN), tenant pays property taxes, insurance, and maintenance
  - tenants also pay for *consequential loss* insurance (in case they can't pay you when building is non-operational)
- Tenants Earn Their Income on Your Premises
  - they fix things quickly themselves to keep operating
  - they are interested in improving the property
- Landlord Pays for Improvements to Commercial Premises
  - you pay for improvements, but tenant pays increased rent at a certain percentage
  - additional benefits to you: depreciate investment, increase value of building at fixed cap rate
  - all at the same time you increase equity, cash flow, collateral, tax write offs, and income
- Certainty of Collecting Rent

# Chapter 4 - The Downsides of Commercial Real Estate
He identifies these common objectives to commercial real estate (and argues against them in ch 6, 9):
- Difficult to acquire tenants
  - residential: can always get a tenant if you drop the rent
  - commercial properties are specific to certain types of tenants
- Banks Lend Less

# Chapter 5 - The True Value of Real Estate
- Residential: Return = Income / Price; Income and price are both market-determined values
- Commercial: Property Value = Income / cap rate
  - Two ways to increase property value are to increase income (ch 8) or decrease cap rate
  - If you can double the income, you can double the value of the property
  - Think like this: "The property is being offered with a return of 11% in a market where prevailing cap rates are 10%"
  - cap rates are entirely determined by the market; return is determined by how well you buy
