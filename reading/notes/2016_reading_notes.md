11/30/16 - The Early History of Rome by Livy
BOOK I - Rome Under the Kings
* “The study of history is the best medicine for a sick mind; for in history you have a record of the infinite variety of human experience plainly set out for all to see; and in that record you can find for yourself and your country both examples and warnings; fine things to take as models, base things, rotten through and through, to avoid.” (30)
* sounds familiar… “Of late years wealth has made us greedy, and self-indulgence has brought us, through every form of sensual excel, to be, if I and so put it, in love with weather both individual and collective.” (30)

    * "Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament...There you will find romance, glory, honor, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that: Death: by the divine paradox, that's which ends life, and demands the surrender of all, and yet by the taste (or foretaste) of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy)  be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man's heart desires. (53-54)
* "You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil" #45, 55

Tolkien, #94, pg 106-107

    * Don’t focus on visible achievement, but on the act of thinking
* Chapter 2 - The Act of Reading
    * “to be enlightened is to understand an idea and use it to make sense of the facts you’ve gathered” (25)
    * concern about speed:
        * 1. reading is the life-long process, so you don’t need to do it all now
        * 2. serious reading is not trying to assimilate as much info as possible, but to understand a few important ideas
    * But, some points from speed readers may be helpful
        * 1. move your eyes smoothly across the page
        * 2. scan the page for context
        * 3. “prior knowledge makes reading easier” should be encouraging: read chronologically and it gets easier
* Chapter 3 - Keep a Journal

    * the goal is to not stuff facts in your head but to understand them
    * Lydia Sigourney: “At the close of every week, abridge in writing, the subjects that you deem most valuable” (38)
    * Notes while reading
        * 1. Write the title of the chapter. Read the whole chapter without stopping. Write down phrases that stand out to you
        * 2. Summarize each section in your own words
        * 3. Glance over your summaries and write your reactions
* Chapter 4 - Final Preparations
    * serious reading is hard work: but can be broken down into manageable steps
    * Grammar
        * Just read and keep reading
        * Underline and take notes on your book
        * When first starting read: title page, table of contents, back cover, preface if by the author/translator (but not others who would be offering an opinion before you get to see the text)
        * Don’t take extensive notes on first reading. Stop at end of each chapter and write a sentence
        * Jot down questions as you read
        * Assemble your summary sentences into an informal outline
        * Give the book a title (4-7 words) and descriptive title to capture what it is really about

            * stop by a professor at a local university
    * Notes on her lists by category
        * “When you read chronologically, you reunite two fields that should never have been separated in the first place: history and literature” (51)
            * it provides you with a continuous story
        * Don’t feel bound by the lists: add or subtract to match your interests
            * Also pick how much to focus on each: some to digest

The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler
* Choosing your market
    1. Lead or bleed - makes the argument to find the next technology going out of style and be the person who gets the new technology to talk to the old technology
    2. Supply and demand - exploit market imbalances or find the places where you can compete at the high end of the market
    3. Coding don't cut it anymore - you need to understand your business 
    4. Be the worst - be the worst guy on the team (and therefore learning from everyone else who is better than you)
    5. Invest in your intelligence - be curious 
    6. Don't listen to your parents - take risks and experience new things 
    7. Be a generalist - software development doesn't follow a nice manufacturing process; there is real value in people who can see across the different dimensions of an organization
    8. Be a specialist - this doesn't mean just not knowing about other things 
    9. Don't put all your eggs in someone else's basket - don't build your career around a single technology that someone else controls; makes the point that if you must focus on a technology, focus on an open source technology 
    10. Love it or leave it - find the thing you want to learn about just for fun 
* Investing in your product 
    1. Learn to fish - take the time to learn to be self-sufficient 
    2. Learn how businesses really work - learn basic business finance and how you contribute to P&L
    3. Find a mentor - particularly helpful for guiding what you should invest your learning time in
    4. Be a mentor - you learn best by teaching (and writing)
    5. Practice - be fluent with the tools of your language, practice with additional fake constraints to stretch yourself 
    6. The way that you do it - improve your software writing process 
    7. On the shoulders of giants - take the opportunity to learn from open source projects 
    8. Automate yourself into a job - be solution-centric instead of technology-centric
* Executing
    1. Right now - treat your project like a race to get it done with speed
    2. Mind reader - work on the things that the organization (or your boss) needs but doesn't quite know they need yet 
    3. Daily hit - aim for a noticeable accomplishment every day (or week) 
    4. Remember who you work for - align your work with your managers needs
    5. Be where you're at - focus on the present and do that well
    6. How good a job can I do today? - work is boring if we can't be creative and aren't challenged: find ways to add these to your boring tasks
    7. How much are you worth? - think in terms of how much value you create for your employer
    8. A pebble in a bucket of water - remember that you are replaceable 
    9. Learn to love maintenance - maintenance is important, undervalued, and an opportunity to really learn the business logic of the organization 
    10. Eight-hour burn - work relentlessly for 8 hours; we are more efficient with scarce resources 
    11. Learn now to fail - raise issues early, take the blame, offer solitons, and ask for help

    13. Don't panic - take a step back to gain perspective to keep from panic if

* Marketing
    1. Perceptions - perceptions matter, so learn how to manage them for the various relationships at work 
    2. Adventure tour guide - remember that people who don't know how to program are on average just as smart, so learn to communicate in a way that makes them comfortable and not feel dumb 
    3. Meet rite reel nice - writing skill is important: you are what you can explain
    4. Be present - people are comfortable with personal interaction, so make an effort to walk over and talk to them or pick up the phone 
    5. Suit speak - be able to explain the business purpose for what it is you are working on 
    6. Change the world - have a mission
    7. Let your voice be heard - publish and speak to get your name out, and start sooner than you think you're ready 
    8. Build your brand - build awareness and positive association 
    9. Release your code - contributing to open source software builds your name and demonstrates your passion for software development 
    10. Remarkability - make remarkable things
    11. Making the hang - reach out to the people you admire in your field, handg out with them, and learn from them 
* Maintaining your edge 
    1. Already obsolete - think of time learning a technology as an investment that depreciates quickly; think ahead to the next technologies
    2. You’ve already lost your job - the job you were hired for no longer exists
    3. Path with no destination - development (the path) is the end, not just the deliverable
    4. Make yourself  a map - you need a personal career map to know where you are heading; think about the story your set of skills tells
    5. Watch the market - similar to the stock market, keep an eye on the market to know what personal development investments you should make
    6. That fat man in the mirror - it’s hard to notice change when you see it every day; take the input of others to understand where you are in your career and uncover your blind spots
    7. The south Indian monkey trap - value rigidity from Zen and Motorcycle maintenance: try to avoid value rigidity when it comes to which technology to use for a particular task
    8. Avoid waterfall career planning - be agile and think in terms of constant change
    9. Better than yourself - make today better than yesterday
    10. Go independent

His Needs, Her Needs by Willard F. Harley, Jr.
* Her most important need is to be shown affection

    * Men view sex as fulfilling sexual needs, women view sex as intimate emotional closeness 
* her 2nd: intimate conversation
* his 2nd: joint recreation activities

Deep Work by  Cal Newport
* Those that win in the new economy are:
    * High Skilled workers - those that play well with complicated machines
    * Superstars - those who are at the very top of what they do 
    * Owners - those with access to capital
* Core abilities to thrive:
    * Ability to quickly master hard things
    * Ability to produce at an elite level in terms of quality and speed 
* Learning hard things takes deliberate practice 
    * Attention focused on the skill to develop
    * Receive feedback to keep attention on the most productive work
* There are three ways to find meaning in deep work:
    * Neurological - “management of attention is the most important thing for living a good life"
        * —> choose carefully and then give rapt attention: live a focused life
    * Psychological - deep work generates flow, and we are happier when we are immersed in something challenging
    * Philosophical - citing All Things Shining (and it’s observation that the enlightenment removed the sacredness from work), we need to refocus on the craftsmanship and sacredness of our work
        * the meaning uncovered is due to skill and appreciation of your work, not the outcome (the code is not noble, but the shaping can be)
* Rule 1 - Work Deeply
    * eudaimonia (Greek concept of the state where you achieve your full potential): eudaimonia machine is a conceptual building with 5 rooms, the last of which provides a protected place for deep work
    * you have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it —> need to add routines and rituals to minimize the amount of willpower we need to deploy
    * Decide on your Deep Work Philosophy
    * 1) Monastic Philosophy - maximize depth by eliminating or radically minimizing shallowness
        * single, well-defined goal as measure of success
    * 2) Bimodal Philosophy - divide your time into regular work, and dedicated (monastic-like) stretches of deep work
    * 3) Rhythmic Philosophy - chain method (do it every day, make it a routine)
        * Define a time for your work and stick to it every day
        * Early wake up time to go your work for 1-2 hours before your real job 
    * 4) Journalistic Philosophy - get away for any small bit you are able
    * Ritualize - where, how work, how support work (food/coffee) 
    * Make grand gestures - like Rowling renting hotel room to finish Harry Potter, a special setting can help put you in the right frame of mind; for me, old building or great library
    * Don’t work alone - hub and spoke model: access to both collaboration and isolation is important
    * Execute like a business - 4 Disciplines of Execution from Clayton Christensen
        * 1) Focus on what is wildly important - say yes to only the most important things
        * 2) Act on the lead measures - lead, not lag: hours of deep work
        * 3) Keep a compelling scoreboard - index card to track your hours of deep work
        * 4) Create a cadence of accountability - regular meetings to assess progress
    * Be Lazy
        * 1) Downtime aids insights - allow your unconscious brain to mull
        * 2) Downtime helps recharge for deep work - go for a walk, and when you disconnect from work you need to fully disconnect
        * 3) The work that evening downtime replaces is not important  - 
            * develop a “shutdown ritual” - review all your tasks at end of day, plan the next day, then shut down
*  Rule 2 - Embrace Boredom
    * 2 goals
        * improve ability to concentrate deeply
        * overcome desire for distraction
    * Take breaks from focus rather than distraction
        * schedule when you use the internet, then avoid it completely when not in those times
        * 1) This works even if your job needs lots of internet/email
            * amount of use doesn’t matter as much as discipline in avoiding when not supposed to
            * 5 minutes for email/internet every 15 minutes
        * 2) You must keep non-internet blocks completely free regardless of how you schedule
            * if you get stuck, either
                * a) switch to another offline activity
                * b) re-schedule internet block or now and adjust remaining schedule accordingly
        * 3) Schedule internet use at home as well
            * waiting and being bored is increasingly rare and increasingly valuable
    * Work like Teddy Roosevelt
        * Estimate time required, shorten the allowed duration, and work with high intensity to meet the objective
    * Productive meditation - use physical/non-mental time (walk, run, etc.) to think about a work problem
        * 1) Be wary of distractions/looping
        * 2) Structure your deep thinking
            * a) define relevant variables of your problem
            * b) define the next-step question to answer with those variables
            * c) review the answer for future use
    * Memorize a deck of cards
        * a side effect of memorizing is your ability to concentrate
        * a) walk through 5 room and remember 10 objects in each room
        * b) associate a memorable person/think with all types of cards
        * c) remember each person in each room to memorize a deck
* Rule 3 - Quit Social Media
    * need to evaluate both the benefits and the costs when choosing which tools to include in our lives
    * The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.
    * Apply the Law of the Vital Few to your Internet Habits
        * a) Identify the main goals in your personal/professional life
        * b) List the 2-3 most important activities to achieve that goal
        * c) If a tool contributes to these, only then should you use it
        * The Law of the Vital Few: 80-20 rule
    * Quit Social Media
        * ban yourself for 30 days - if still useful after that ban then reintroduce; otherwise delete
        * social media removes the connection between hard work producing content and people paying attention to you: I’ll pay attention to you if you pay attention to me even if neither of us really adds any value
    * Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself
        *  How to Live on 24 Hours a Day: see the time before/after work as a “day within a day"
        * put some thought into structuring your leisure time to give yourself a quality alternative to distraction during your leisure time
* Rule 4 - Drain the Shallows
    * Schedule Every Minute of Your Day
        * http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/
    * goal it not to stick to plan 100%, but to be thoughtful about how you spend your time
    * Quantify the Depth of Each Activity
        * Shallow work: noncoygnitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
        * How long would it take to train a smart recent college grad with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?
    * Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget
    * Finish Your Work by 5:30
        * fixed-schedule productivity: set a limit of fight hours a week and work backward to determine what rules and habits were needed to satisfy that constraint
    * Become Hard to Reach
        * Make people who send you email do more work
        * Do more work when you send or reply to emails
            * Determine the “project” represented by the email and find the most efficient process for concluding the project
        * Don’t respond
            * Tim Ferriss: “Develop the habit of letting small and things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never ind time for the life-changing big things."
* Winifred Gallagher: “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is."

The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham
* Chapter 2 - to protect against inflation, invest in REITs or TIPS
* Analogy of Mr. Market...need to not play into the whims of the current market 
* Investing isn't about bearing other people at their game, it's about controlling yourself in your own game 

For Better by Tara Parker-Pope
* Compatibility: excessively worrying about compatibility is a danger sign for the relationship. Compatibility is important, but plenty of happy couples aren't ideally compatible, and plenty of compatible couples aren't happy.
* Arguments
    * using we/us is a lot better than you
    * articulate complaints ("I feel" or "I don't like") instead of criticisms ("you always...")
* Women often lose sex drive while nursing 
* They suggest still having sex often (quickie) when you have kids - you get the same chemical benefits even if sex is short
* Women often get more of the share of house work after a baby is born. They need to let the husband take some of the load without micromanaging
* Kids want time with their parents, but having peanuts who aren't tired and stressed is more important 
* Group couples therapy can have a large positive impact for parents 
* Investing in your relationship is one of the most important things you can do for the wellbeing of your kids 
* Important factors: passion, intimacy, commitment 
* To not get divorced:
    * Marry after 25
    * Marry someone with a college degree
    * Stick it out for at least 10 years
    * Someone with similar intrrrst, background, and values

Walden by Henry David Thoreau
* After we have the basic necessities of life (food, shelter, fire, clothing) why keep working? We should "adventure on life" (11-14)
* The present moment: "to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future" (14)
* "In the long run men bit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high" (21-22)
* Think about housing (and other costs) in terms of the "life equivalent" (24)
* "Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have (27)"
* "I intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street in Concord in grandeur and luxury, as soon as it pleases me as much and will cost me no more than my present one (37)"
* “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came toddy, discover that I had not lived” (65)
* "I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time…I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude" (94-95)

Why Teach by Mark Edmundson
* Reading: we need to read authors through the lens of that author, not though the lens of subsequent authors. We should treat the author like a friend who we are representing to another friend: charitable to their worldview in how we give an account of their writing that they would agree is fair
* We need to allow faith to enter into the teaching of humanities, to let the students bring their "final vocabulary" (their final principles, how they assign meaning in the world, their faith) into the conversation so it can be examined and open to change 
* Great book: one that can inspire you to change how you live
* Study other cultures, yes, but not at the expense of knowing yourself (your own culture)

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig
* don’t hurry things that matter (34)
* reading Walden to his son: read a line or two and then just chat about it (49)
* any system is defined by the knife that cuts it up into smaller parts. Therefore, it is just as important to focus on the “knife” we use to understand something as the something itself (92)
* “Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.” (381)
* “Or if he takes whatever dull job he’s stuck with—and they are all, sooner or later, dull—and, just to keep himself amused, starts to look for options of Quality, and secretly pursues these options, just for their own sake, thus making an art out of what he is doing, he’s likely to discover that he becomes a much more interesting person and much less of an object to the people around him because his Quality decisions change him too. And not only the job and him, but others too because the Quality tends to fan out like waves. The Quality job he didn’t think anyone was going to see is seen, and the person who sees it feels a little better because of it, and is likely to pass that feeling on to others, and in that way the Quality tends to keep on going.” (460)
