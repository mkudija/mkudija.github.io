12/17/13 - Change by Design by Tim Brown
Introduction
* "I realized that behind the soaring rhetoric of 'genius' and 'visionary' was a basic commitment to the principles of design thinking." (6)
Chapter 1 - Getting Under Your Skin or how design thinking is about more than style
* "Linear thinking is about sequences; mind maps are about connections." (9)
* "spaces" of design thinking are iterative and nonlinear (16)
    * inspiration - the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions
    * ideation - the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas
    * implementation - the path that leads from the project room to the market
* "Fail early to succeed sooner." (17)
* "The mark of a designer is a willing embrace of constraints." (17) --> necessary to get started
    * constraints are viewed in terms of feasibility (functionally possible), viability (sustainable business model), and desirability
* The Project: Design thinkers need to think in terms of projects instead of problems: a project carries an idea from concept to reality (21)
* The Brief: mental constraints to give you somewhere to start (22)
* Smart Teams: "all of us are smarter than any of us" (26), organized in many small teams
Chapter 2 - Converting need into demand or putting people first
* Human-centered design has three elements:
    * Insight - learning from the lives of others
    * Observation - watching what people don't do and listening to what they don't say
    * Empathy - standing in the shoes of others
* These principles must extend beyond the individual to the network, market, or "wisdom crowds"
Chapter 3 - A mental matrix or "these people have no process!"
* Types of thinking:
    * Convergent thinking - useful for deciding between existing alternatives (but not good at creating the future)
    * Divergent thinking - objective is to multiply options to create choices
    * Analysis - 
    * Synthesis - organizing and interpreting data to create a coherent story; extracting meaningful patterns from raw data
* Rules for an attitude of experimentation
    * Best ideas emerge when the whole organization can experiment
    * Those most exposed to changing externalities are the best placed to respond
    * Ideas should not be favored based on who creates them
    * Ideas that create a buzz should be favored
    * Senior leadership should tend, prune, and harvest ideas --> "risk tolerance"
    * An overarching sense of direction should be articulated so there is a sense of direction and not a constant need for supervision
* Culture of optimism - the unshakable belief that things could be better than they are
* Brainstorming - a structured way of breaking out of structure
    * Defer judgment
    * Encourage wild ideas
    * Stay focused on the topic
    * Build on the ideas of others
Chapter 4 - Building to think or the power of prototyping
* prototyping is faster because it helps you to think
Chapter 5 - Returning to the surface or the design of experiences
* a good idea is no longer enough - in developed societies we care about the experience of products
* our society is moving away from passive consumption to active participation
Chapter 6 - Spreading the message or the importance of storytelling
* we rely on storytelling to put our ideas in context and give them meaning
Chapter 7 - Design thinking meets the corporation or teaching to fish
* a
Chapter 8 - The new social contract, or we're all in this together
* a
Chapter 9 - Design activism, or inspiring solutions with global potential
* a
Chapter 10 - Designing tomorrow, today
* Design thinking requires bridging the knowing-doing gap (Pfeffer and Sutton) (227)
* most people have what it takes to apply design thinking to the problems of life
* Begin at the Beginning
    * design thinking starts with divergence (expand the range of options)
* Take a human-centered approach
    * design thinking is by its nature integrative, but privileges the intended user
    * account for emotional meaning as well as functional performance
    * common approaches
        * Start with prevailing business constraints --> leads to incremental, easily-copied ideas
        * Start with technology --> risky
        * Start with humans --> increases the likelihood of a breakthrough and a market for it
    * Get as close as you can to your intended customers
* Fail early, Fail often
    * there is nothing wrong with failure as long as it happens early and is a source of learning
    * prototyping
* Get professional help
    * to to the experts
* Share the inspiration
    * knowledge sharing should support inspiration instead of efficiency
    * face to face time is invaluable
* Blend big and small projects
    * there is no silver bullet, only silver buckshot
* Budget to the pace of innovation
    * rethink funding schedules, agile resource allocation
* Find talent any way you can
    * find the people in your organization who are different and can make innovation happen
* Design for the cycle
    * make sure your person career life cycles are not shorter than the product cycle: want the same people and passion
* Don't ask what, ask why?
    * ask why to reframe a problem, redefine the constraints, and open the field to a more innovative answer
    * is this the right problem to be solving?
* Open your eyes
    * good design thinkers observe, great design thinkers observe the ordinary: once a day, stop and think about an ordinary situation
* Make it visual
    * record your observations and ideas visually
    * "Every designer I know carries a sketch pad the way a doctor carries a stethoscope." (238)
    * "Don't think.  Look." -Ludwig Wittgenstein (238)
* Build on the ideas of others
    * all of us are smarter than any of us
* Demand options
    * don't settle for the first good idea
* Balance your portfolio
    * document the process
* Design a life
    * think of life as a prototype

12/17/13 - The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis
The Magician's Nephew
* "Digory was the sort of person who wants to know everything." (39)
* "I expect most witches are like that.  The are not interested in things or people unless they can use them; they are terribly practical." (79)

12/11/13 - Meditations in a Toolshed by C.S. Lewis
* looking at something and looking along something are different, but not one better than the other
* in modern thought, we tend to favor looking at and discount looking along: "That is why a great deal of contemporary thought is, strictly speaking, though about nothing - all the apparatus of though busily working in a vacuum."
* "We must, on pain of idiocy, deny from the very outset the idea that looking at is, by its own nature, intrinsically truer or better than looking along.  One must look both along and at everything."

12/5/13 - Jesus Shock by Peter Kreeft
* From Pascal's Penseés: "Not only do we only know God through Jesus Christ, but we only know ourselves through Jesus Christ; we only know life and death through Jesus Christ.  Apart from Jesus Christ we cannot know the meaning of our life, or our death, of God or of ourselves." (22)
* The core of the disagreement of the reformation was not justification by faith, religion and politics, the Bible, the corruption of the Church, the Pope, Mary/the saints, purgatory: it was about the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist (29)
* the Church as the "Theory of Everything", the unified field theory in religion (29)
* George Macdonld's The Golden Key is his favorite fairy tale (and Tolkien's also) (33)
    * the Golden Key is allegorical for Christ
* "Because of His omnipresence, nothing is secular…He unites everything except sin." (36)
* "God is such a gentlemen that He asked permission from His mother to be born! (48)
* "Find a parish that sings.  Better yet, make your parish a parish that sings." (53)
* The transcendentals: 
    * Beauty, Truth, Goodness
    * "These are the three things we all want infinitely an absolutely.  They are the three attributes of God our very nature tells us about." (53)
    * Christianity is succeeding in Truth and Goodness, but not beauty anymore
* From Meditation in a Toolshed by C.S. Lewis: "Everything in this world is to be looked-along, and God looked-at, for everything is a means and God is the end." (122)
* "Man is a cathedral, and God is the builder." (132)
* "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit! 1 Corinthians 6:19
* "The Eucharist is a sword.  It is pointed at your heart.  This is not a clever ploy of mine, an image I invented; it is pure scriptural logic.  For the Eucharist is Christ, and Christ is the Word of God, and the Word of God is a sword." (143)
* LOTR reference 146
* quote 156: he loves us for our own sake

12/2/13 - Evangelii Gaudium by Pope Francis
* Introduction
    * "The great danger in today’s world, pervaded as it is by consumerism, is the desolation and anguish born of a complacent yet covetous heart, the feverish pursuit of frivolous pleasures, and a blunted conscience." (2)
    * "whenever we take a step towards Jesus, we come to realize that he is already there, waiting for us with open arms...God never tires of forgiving us; we are the ones who tire of seeking his mercy." (3)
    * "We become fully human when we become more than human, when we let God bring us beyond ourselves in order to attain the fullest truth of our being." (8)
    * "For if we have received the love which restores meaning to our lives, how can we fail to share that love with others?" (8)
    * "the new evangelization is a summons addressed to all and that it is carried out in three principal settings" (14)
        * ordinary pastoral ministry
        * the baptized whose lives do not reflect the demands of Baptism
        * those who do not know Jesus Christ or who have always rejected him
        * "Christians have the duty to proclaim the Gospel without excluding anyone." (15)
        * "today missionary activity still represents the greatest challenge for the Church" (15)
    * Decentralization: "I am conscious of the need to promote a sound “decentralization”." (16)
    * Topics he discusses in more detail:
        * a) the reform of the Church in her missionary outreach;
    * b) the temptations faced by pastoral workers;c) the Church, understood as the entire People of God which evangelizes;d) the homily and its preparation;e) the inclusion of the poor in society; f) peace and dialogue within society;g) the spiritual motivations for mission.
* I - THE CHURCH’S MISSIONARY TRANSFORMATION
    * A CHURCH WHICH GOES FORTH
        * "All of us are asked to obey his call to go forth from our own comfort zone in order to reach all the “peripheries” in need of the light of the Gospel." (20)
        * "God’s word is unpredictable in its power. The Gospel speaks of a seed which, once sown, grows by itself, even as the farmer sleeps (Mk 4:26-29). The Church has to accept this unruly freedom of the word, which accomplishes what it wills in ways that surpass our calculations and ways of thinking." (22)
        * "The joy of the Gospel is for all people: no one can be excluded." (23)
    * PASTORAL ACTIVITY AND CONVERSION
        * "“Mere administration” can no longer be enough.21 Throughout the world, let us be “permanently in a state of mission”." (25)
        * The Church must constantly be self-aware and looking inward for renewal (26)
        * "Wherever the need for the light and the life of the Risen Christ is greatest, [the Church] will want to be there." (30)
        * Leadership of a Bishop: sometimes going before his people, sometimes walking among them, sometimes walking after them to help those who lag (31)
        *  we need to be creative and not use the excuse "it's always been done this way" - makes me think about SpaceX's philosophy toward designing rockets (33)
    * FROM THE HEART OF THE GOSPEL
        * on the centrality of the Gospel: "The biggest problem is when the message we preach then seems identified with those secondary aspects which, important as they are, do not in and of themselves convey the heart of Christ’s message. We need to be realistic and not assume that our audience understands the full background to what we are saying, or is capable of relating what we say to the very heart of the Gospel which gives it meaning, beauty and attractiveness." (34)
        * "“in Catholic doctrine there exists an order or a ‘hierarchy’ of truths, since they vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith”" (36)
        * From St. Thomas Aquinas: "mercy is the greatest virtue" (37)
        * on the unity of truth: "each truth is better understood when related to the harmonious totality of the Christian message; in this context all of the truths are important and illumine one another" (39)
        * purpose of the Gospel: "Before all else, the Gospel in- vites us to respond to the God of love who saves us, to see God in others and to go forth from ourselves to seek the good of others." (39)
    * A MISSION EMBODIED WITHIN HUMAN LIMITS
        * "But in fact such variety [in thought, philosophy, practice, etc.] serves to bring out and develop different facets of the inexhaustible riches of the Gospel." (40)
        * truths are unchanging, but we need to learn how to present them in a new way: "At the same time, today’s vast and rapid cultural changes demand that we constantly seek ways of expressing unchanging truths in a lan- guage which brings out their abiding newness." (40)
        * we don't want the Church to become rule (Law) dominated: "SaintThomas Aquinas pointed out that the pre- cepts which Christ and the apostles gave to the people of God “are very few”" (43)
    * A MOTHER WITH AN OPEN HEART
        * "The Eucharist, although it is the fullness of sacramental life, is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak." (47)
        * we need to preach to the poor first: "We have to state, without mincing words, that there is an inseparable bond between our faith and the poor." (48)
        * a bruised Church: "I prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security." (49)
* II - AMID THE CRISIS OF COMMUNAL COMMITMENT
    * SOME CHALLENGES OF TODAY’S WORLD
        * our world is characterized by many barely getting by; and increasing reliance on technology
        * "We have created a “throw away” culture" (53)
        * denounces traditional trickle-down economics (54)
        * it is OUR CALL to help the poor: "Almost without being aware of it, we end up being incapable of feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people’s pain, and feeling a need to help them, as though all this were someone else’s responsibility and not our own." (54)
        * financial markets are our new idols (55)
        * "Money must serve, not rule!" (58)
        * "But until exclusion and inequal- ity in society and between peoples are reversed, it will be impossible to eliminate violence." (59)
        * relativism: "We should recognize how in a culture where each person wants to be bearer of his or her own subjective truth, it becomes difficult for citizens to devise a common plan which transcends individual gain and personal ambitions." (61)
        * secularization (64)
        * on marriage: "the indispensible contribution of marriage to society transcends the feelings and momen- tary needs of the couple" (66)
        * we need a culture of faith (68)
    * TEMPTATIONS FACED BY PASTORAL WORKERS
        * dangers that pastoral workers face (78):
            * heightened individualism
            * crisis of identity
            * cooling of fervor
        * we must not resist fully giving ourselves over to God (81)
        * we must be of service: "To go out of ourselves and to join others is healthy for us. To be self-enclosed is to taste the bitter poi- son of immanence, and humanity will be worse for every selfish choice we make." (87)
        * we can't hide in our group of friends (88)
        * we must find Christ in others (98)
        * relativism vs. orthodoxy (94)
        * women in the Church: "But we need to create still broader opportunities for a more incisive female presence in the Church." (103)
        * challenges: "Challenges exist to be overcome!" (109)
* III - THE PROCLAMATION OF THE GOSPEL
    * THE ENTIRE PEOPLE OF GOD PROCLAIMS THE GOSPEL
        * Jesus Christ is the foundation of evangelization (110)
        * salvation is a gift: "The salvation which God offers us is the work of his mercy. No human efforts, however good they may be, can enable us to merit so great a gift." (112)
        * the Church must be open: "The Church must be a place of mercy freely giv- en, where everyone can feel welcomed, loved, forgiven and encouraged to live the good life of the Gospel." (114)
        * the diversity of the Church is its Catholicity (116); and diversity is not a threat to unity (117)
        * therefore, we do not need to impose our western "form" on new cultures (117)
        * humility recognizes that we need to be evangelized also, but this can't stop us from evangelizing always (121)
        * "Being human means “being at the same time son and father of the culture to which one belongs”." (122)
        * how to evangelize:  all of 128, especially:  "This message has to be shared humbly as a testimony on the part of one who is always willing to learn, in the awareness that the message is so rich and so deep that it always exceeds our grasp." (128)
        * authenticity of charism: "A sure sign of the authenticity of a charism is its ecclesial charac- ter, its ability to be integrated harmoniously into the life of God’s holy and faithful people for the good of all." (130)
        * we need a "creative apologetics" for science, etc: "Proclaiming the Gospel message to differ- ent cultures also involves proclaiming it to pro- fessional, scientific and academic circles. This means an encounter between faith, reason and the sciences with a view to developing new ap- proaches and arguments on the issue of credibil- ity, a creative apologetics" (132)
        * a new theology: "A theology – and not simply a pastoral theology – which is in dialogue with other sciences and human experiences is most important for our discernment on how best to bring the Gospel message to different cultural contexts and groups." (133)
            * *****Should this theology come from theologians or scientists/engineers?
    * THE HOMILY
        * "The homily is the touchstone for judging a pastor’s closeness and ability to communicate to his people." (135)
        * a love of words: "Dialogue is much more than the com- munication of a truth. It arises from the en- joyment of speaking and it enriches those who express their love for one another through the medium of words." (142)
        * synthesis: "Where your synthesis is, there lies your heart." (143)
    * PREPARING TO PREACH
        * we must let the Word permeate our lives: "He needs to approach the word with a docile and prayerful heart so that it may deeply penetrate his thoughts and feelings and bring about a new outlook in him”." (149)
        * don't respond to questions that nobody asks (155)
    * EVANGELIZATION AND THE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE KERYGMA
        * truth, goodness, and beauty: "Every expression of true beauty can thus be ac- knowledged as a path leading to an encounter with the Lord Jesus. This has nothing to do with fostering an aesthetic relativism which would downplay the inseparable bond between truth, goodness and beauty, but rather a renewed esteem for beauty as a means of touching the human heart and enabling the truth and goodness of the Risen Christ to radiate within it." (167)
        * accompaniment (169)
        * we need to listen (171)
        * Scripture is the basis of evangelization, so we must be continually instructed in Scripture (171)
        * and Scripture must be available to every believer (172)
* IV - THE SOCIAL DIMENSION OF EVANGELIZATION
    * COMMUNAL AND SOCIETAL REPERCUSSIONS OF THE KERYGMA
        * definition of evangelization: "To evangelize is to make the kingdom of God present in our world." (176)
        * must accept the guidance of the creativity of the Holy Spirit (end of 178)
        * religion can't be private: "It is no longer possible to claim that religion should be restricted to the private sphere and that it exists only to prepare souls for heaven. We know that God wants his children to be happy in this world too, even though they are called to fulfilment in eternity, for he has created all things “for our enjoyment” (1 Tim 6:17)" (182)
        * authentic faith: "An authentic faith – which is never comfortable or completely personal – always involves a deep desire to change the world, to transmit values, to leave this earth somehow better that we found it." (183)
        * the Pope doesn't have a monopoly on solutions to social problems (184)
        * the two biggest problems: "In what follows I intend to concentrate on two great issues which strike me as fundamental at this time in history...I believe that they will shape the future of humanity. These issues are first, the inclusion of the poor in society, and second, peace and social dialogue." (185)
    * THE INCLUSION OF THE POOR IN SOCIETY
        * solidarity affects our relationship with God: "A lack of solidarity towards his or her needs will directly affect our relationship with God" (187)
        * our work: "In this context we can understand Jesus’ com- mand to his disciples: “You yourselves give them something to eat!” (Mk 6:37): it means working to eliminate the structural causes of poverty and to promote the integral development of the poor, as well as small daily acts of solidarity in meeting the real needs which we encounter." (188)
        * private property and justice: "The private ownership of goods is justified by the need to protect and increase them, so that they can better serve the common good; for this reason, solidarity must be lived as the decision to restore to the poor what belongs to them." (189)
        * the rich: "“the more fortunate should renounce some of their rights so as to place their goods more generously at the service of others”" (190)
        * a poor Church: "This is why I want a Church which is poor and for the poor. They have much to teach us. Not only do they share in the sensus fidei, but in their difficul- ties they know the suffering Christ. We need to let ourselves be evangelized by them." (198)
        * "True love is always contemplative." (199)
        * the preferential option for the poor includes religious care of the Church (200)
        * need to reject autonomy of financial markets, and "Inequality is the root of all social ills" (202)
        * Business as a Vocation: "Business is a vocation, and a noble vocation, provided that those engaged in it see themselves challenged by a greater meaning in life; this will enable them truly to serve the common good by striving to increase the goods of this world and to make them more accessible to all." (203)
        * economic discussion (204)
        * politics is a noble vocation as long as it seeks the common good (205)
        * we need a more efficient way of interacting for a healthy economy (206)
        * "Human beings are ends in themselves and never a means to resolving other problems." (213)
    * THE COMMON GOOD AND PEACE IN SOCIETY
        * need integral development for peace: "In the end, a peace which is not the re- sult of integral development will be doomed; it will always spawn new conflicts and various forms of violence." (219)
        * we must participate in politics (220)
        * Tensions
            * between fullness and limitation (222)
                * time is greater than space (222)
                * work slowly and don't obsess over results (223)
                * conflict must be faced (226)
            * between ideas and realities (231)
                * "There has to be continuous dialogue between the two, lest ideas become detached from realities. It is dangerous to dwell in the realm of words alone, of imag- es and rhetoric...realities are greater than ideas." (231)
            * between globalization and localization (234)
                * "The whole is greater than the part, but it is also greater than the sum of its parts." (235)
    * SOCIAL DIALOGUE AS A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE
        * faith and reason: "Faith is not fearful of reason; on the contrary, it seeks and trusts reason, since 'the light of reason and the light of faith both come from God' and cannot contradict each other." (242, citing Saint Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra Gentiles, I, 7; cf. John Paul II Encyclical Letter Fides et Ratio, (14 September 1998), 43: AAS 91 (1999), 39.
        * about science (243)
        * ecumenism: "The credibility of the Christian message would be much greater if Christians could overcome their divisions and the Church could realize “the fullness of catholicity proper to her in those of her children who, though joined to her by baptism, are yet separated from full communion with her”. We must never forget that we are pilgrims journeying alongside one another. This means that we must have sincere trust in our fellow pilgrims, putting aside all suspicion or mistrust, and turn our gaze to what we are all seeking: the radiant peace of God’s face. (244)
        * see the gifts of the Holy Spirit in others (246)
        * balancing openness vs. steadfastness in belief: "True openness involves remaining steadfast in one’s deepest convictions, clear and joyful in one’s own identity, while at the same time being “open to understanding those of the other party” and “knowing that dialogue can enrich each side”." (251)
* V - SPIRIT-FILLED EVANGELIZERS 
    * REASONS FOR A RENEWED MISSIONARY IMPULSE
        * importance of prayer: "Let us call upon him today, firmly rooted in prayer, for without prayer all our activity risks being fruitless and our message empty." (259)
        * sharing God's love: "What kind of love would not feel the need to speak of the beloved, to point him out, to make him known? If we do not feel an intense desire to share this love, we need to pray insistently that he will once more touch our hearts." (264)
        * "Appearances notwithstanding, every person is immensely holy and deserves our love." (274)
        * we need to invoke the Spirit constantly (280)
    * MARY, MOTHER OF EVANGELIZATION
        * "Jesus left us his mother to be our mother." (285)

quote about knowing your faith

10/23/13 - The Four Loves by CS Lewis
The four loves:
1. Affection
2. Friendship
3. Eros
4. Charity
* "Of course language is not an infallible guide, but it contains, with all its defects, a good deal of stored insight and experience." (2)
* "Man approaches God most nearly when he is in one sense least like God." (4)
* "A true philosophy may sometimes validate an experience of nature; an experience of nature cannot validate a philosophy.  Nature will not verify any theological or metaphysical proposition (or not in the manner we are now considering); she will help to show what it means." (20)
* "Say your prayers in a garden early, ignoring steadfastly the dew, the birds and the flowers, and you will come away overwhelmed by its freshness and joy; go there in order to be overwhelmed and, after a certain age, nine times out of ten nothing will happen to you." (22)
* great discussion of the proper role of patriotism on pg. 23
* quote about gin, 34
* "But the proper aim of giving is to put the recipient in a state where he no longer needs our gift." (50)
* individuality, Catholicism, and friendship pg. 60
* "In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out…Hence true Friendship is the least jealous of loves.  Two friends delight to be joined by a third, and three by a fourth, if only the newcomer is qualified to become a real friend." (61)
* "The very condition of having Friends is that we should want something else besides Friends." (66)
* "Nothing so enriches an erotic love as the discovery that the Beloved can reply, truly and spontaneously enter into Friendship with the Friend you already had: to feel that not only are we two united by erotic love but that we three or four or five are all travelers on the same quest, have all a common vision." (67)
* "The little knots of Friends who turn their backs on the "World" are those who really transform it." (69)
* "[Friendship] has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival." (71)
* cautions agains individual humility leading to group pride (83)
* "Perhaps we may now hazard a guess why Scripture uses Friendship so rarely as an image of the highest love.  It is already, in actual fact, too spiritual to be a good symbol of Spiritual things." (87)
* “In friendship...we think we have chosen our peers. In reality a few years' difference in the dates of our births, a few more miles between certain houses, the choice of one university instead of another...the accident of a topic being raised or not raised at a first meeting--any of these chances might have kept us apart. But, for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking, no chances. A secret Master of Ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you," can truly say to every group of Christian friends, "You have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another." The friendship is not a reward for our discriminating and good taste in finding one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each of us the beauties of others…They are, like all beauties, derived from Him, and then, in a good Friendship, increased by Him through the Friendship itself, so that it is His instrument for creating as well as for revealing.”  -C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves (89-90)
* I should re-read the section on eros when I am closer to marriage
* all human beings pass away, so we should not put too much love in them (according to Augustine, 120)
* “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket--safe, dark, motionless, airless--it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation.  The only place outsie Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.”  -C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves (121)
* a definition of Hate, 123
* "We cannot see light, thought by light we can see things.  Statements about God are extrapolations from the knowledge of other things which the divine illumination enables us to know." (126)
* "There are no tenses in God." (127)
* "'Thou has made us for thyself and our heart has not rest till it comes to Thee.'" (St. Augustine, 138)

    * our hearts have a "God-shaped hole"
* God is found the the simple things - often simple desires
* "Every time that I have gone up in an airplane and looking down have realized that I was free of the ground, I have had the consciousness of a great new discovery.  'I see:' I have thought, 'This was the idea.  And now I understand everything.'" (Out of Africa by Isak Dinesen)

* "Knowing God is more important than knowing about God." (Karl Rahner)
* If you want to know God, get to know Jesus. 
    * and get to know the saints - "they are a clean window through which the light of God can shine" (120)
* Aristotle believed we become like the object of our contemplation (140)
* Preaching to the Converted
Chapter 7 - God meets you where you are
* Lectio Divina - read, meditate, pray, act
    * what does the text say
    * what is God saying to me through the text?
    * what do you want to say to God about the text?

        * quiet down
        * repeat a single word
        * gently return to that word if we become distracted by anything
Chapter 8 - The Simple Life
* simplicity moves us away from disordered attachment
* Notes from Dean Brackley's "Downward Mobility:"
    * consumer culture is primarily individualistic
    * we are temped to consume to relieve insecurity
    * leads to the ladder of society, with some higher than others
    * show our status through job titles, possessions, credentials, etc.
    * we gradually interiorize these external measures
    * top of ladder is a mythical figure, bottom is the homeless
    * competition becomes the guiding force for social life
    * one's security depends on climbing
    * social model is not just a ladder, but a pyramid
    * no everyone can be on top
    * social class, race, etc. lead to further divisions
    * competition breeds mistrust and fear
* Lord of the Rings as a means of understanding Ignatius' use of the metaphor of battle between good and evil
    * "riches to honors to price" (190)
* voluntary poverty reminds us to help the poor - "extra coat hanging in your closet belongs not to you; it belongs to a poor person" (195).
* "living simply means that one needs less and takes less from the world, and is therefore more able to give to those who live in poverty.  Living simply can aid the poor." (197).
* being poor brings us closer to God (201)
* How to live simply:
    * Get rid of whatever you don't need
    * Distinguish between needs and wants
    * Get rid of things you think you need, but can actually live without
    * Get to know the poor
* Poverty of spirit means accepting that we are powerless to change certain aspects of our lives (206)

    * Third Degree: you actually choose the most humble way in imitation of Christ
Chapter 9 - Chastity
* Arrupe quote about falling in love (219)
* "Love ought to maintain itself more by deeds than words." (Ignatius, 220)
* love cannot be owned

    * listen compassionately
    * be present
    * do something practical
    * love freely
    * forgive
    * pray
Chapter 10 - Friendship and Love
* the times when you are most tempted to move away from your friends are precisely the times when you most need those relationships and need to cultivate them (251)
* good friends know about each other's lives
* if God is at the center of a relationship there's always more room for others
Chapter 11 - Obedience
* from latin root meaning to hear
* "Poverty frees you to live dimly and frees you from worry about material possessions. Chastity frees you to love people freely and move around more easily.  Obedience frees you from excessive self-interest, careerism, and pride and allows you to respond more really to the larger needs of the community" (270)
Chapter 12 - Making Decisions
* The Three Times
    * First Time - decision comes without doubt
    * Second Time - less clear initially
        * live for a few days as if you've made decision and see how it feels
    * Third Time - less clear; Ignatius give us two methods
        * First Method - relies on reason
            * put yourself in prayer
            * identify the ultimate objectives
            * ask God for help to move your heart toward the better decision
            * make a list of positive and negative outcomes
            * pray about your list

        * Second Method - relies of imagination
            * imagine giving advice to someone you don't know in the same situation
            * imagine yourself at the point of death
            * imagine yourself at the last judgement

    * keeping a journal can be helpful because you can look back to when you were close with God
* Three ways the enemy works (333)
    * like a spoiled child
    * like a false lover
    * like an army commander - attacks the weakest point
* remember there is no perfect outcome, and we need to be ok with the imperfection
Chapter 13 - Vocation
* universal call to holiness - everyone has a vocation
* "Vocation overarches our work, jobs, and career and extends to the kind of person we hope to become.  It is what we are called to do and who we are called to be" (342).
* desire plays a role - find our vocations through our natural longings
* "Vocation is less about finding one and more about having it revealed to you, as you pray to understand what I want and desire" (343).
* find God in your work, particularly in the people around you
* we are like leaven (Mt. 13:33) with the people around us and a small change/influence can make a big difference (355)

    * Self-awareness: reflection, action, reflection
    * Ingenuity

6/15/13 - The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer

4/3/13 Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis
* 1) Everyone knows Natural Law and no one is able to fully follow it
* 2) Piano Metaphor: keys = impulses; sheet music = moral code
* "If you are thinking about becoming a Christian, I warn you, you are embarking on something which his going to take the whole of you, brains and all…one of the reasons why it needs no special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education itself" (78)
* The chapter on Social Morality (esp. 86-87) gives an uplifting challenge for approaching poverty and how we respond:
    * "If our expenditure on comforts, luxuries, amusements, etc., is up to the standard common among those with the same income as our own, we are probably giving away too little" (86).
    * "Most of us are not really approaching the subject in order to find out what Christianity says: we are approaching it in the hope of finding support from Christianity for the views of our own party" (87).
* On Sexual Morality:
    * "I would much rather say that every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before" (92).
    * "Good people know about both good and evil: bad people do not know about either" (93).
* On Marriage:
    * "it is just the people who are ready to submit to the loss of the thrill and settle down to the sober interest, who are the most likely to meet new thrills in some quite different direction…this is, I think, one little part of what Christ meant by saying that a thing will not really live unless it first dies" (110-111).
* Pride is the central evil
* On Charity:
    * "Do not waste time bother whether you 'love' your neighbor; act as if you did.  As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets.  When you are behaving as if foul over someone, you will presently come to love him" (131).
    * "Good and evil both increase at compound interest.  That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance" (132).
    * "Ask yourself, 'If I were sure that I loved God, what would I go?'  When you have found the answer, go and do it" (132).
* On Faith:
    * "No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good" (142).
    * "The main thing we learn from a serious attempt to practice the Christian virtues is that we fail" (142).
* Theology is to seeing god as a map is to walking on the beach: walking on the beach is better but you need a map if you want to get anywhere, and the map is built on the experience of all those who have gone before you
* Purpose and the meaning of life: "The whole purpose for which we exist is to be thus taken into the life of God" (161).
* “If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world can satisfy, the only logical explanation is that I was made for another world.” - C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity (don't know the page number)
