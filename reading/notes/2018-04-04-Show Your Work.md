2018-04-04

# Introduction
- you don't find your audience, they find you...but you have to be *findable*
- this is a book about sharing for people who hate self-promotion; about influencing others by letting them steal from you
- "Imagine spending the majority of your tiem, energy, and attention practicing a craft, learning a trade, or running a business, while also allowing for the possibility that your work might attract a group of people who share your interests. All you have to do is *show your work*."

# 1. You don't have to be a genius
**Find a scenius**
- the lone, creative, antisocial genius is a myth
- rather the works of these people come from gropus of creative individuals, an "ecology of talent", a *scenius*
- the Internet makes it easy to join a scenius

**Be an amateur**
- *amateur*: "enthusiast who pursues work in the spirit of love, regardless of the potential for fame, money, or career"
- amateurs have an advantage because they have nothing to lose and are able to take risks
- contributing something is better than contributing nothing
- quotes Lewis: "It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better tha nthe master can" (16)
- "The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others." (19)

**You can't find your voice if you don't use it**
- "in this day and age, if your work isn't online, it doesn't exist" (23)

**Read obituaries**
- *memento mori*
- obituaries aren't really about death; they're about life


# 2. Think process, not product

**Take people behind the scenes**
- "human being are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do" (36)

**Become a documentarian of what you do**
- David Carr: "You have to make stuff. No one is going to give a damn about your résumé; they want to see what you have make with your own little fingers." (41)
- Documentarian: keep a work journal, take photos of your work, etc.
- You'll see your own progress, and have material to share when you're ready
