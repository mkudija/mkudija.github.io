## Intro
1. Stop
  - Formulate (what you want from productivity)
  - Evaluate (high vs low leverage work)
  - Rejuvenate (use rest to be more productive)
2. Cut
  - Eliminate (cut out time wasters)
  - Automate (for low leverage work)
  - Delegate (get work off your plate)
3. Act
  - Consolidate (three categories of activity)
  - Designate (stage tasks and fight urgency)
  - Activate (eliminate interruptions and distractions)

# Part 1 - Stop

## Chapter 1 - Formulate
- *Efficiency* and *success* aren't the best goals of productivity
- The real objective is *the freedom to pursue what's most important to you* (33)
  - freedom to focus, be present, be spontaneous, do nothing
- Exercise: **Productivity Vision**

## Chapter 2 - Evaluate
- focus on tasks for which you have **passion** and **proficiency** (45)
  - **passion**: "I can't believe they are paying me to do this"
  - **proficiency**: you have *skill* plus *contribution*
- Charlie "Tremendous" Jones: You will be the same person in five years as you are today except for the people you meet and the books you read." (50)
- Zones of productivity
  - Productivity = more of Desire Zone [Zone 1] and less of everything else (57)
  - Development zone = not in Desire Zone yet, but moving that direction

- Freedom Compass

- Don't let your midset limit your productivity

## Chapter 3 - Rejuvenate
- Rule of 50: working more than 50 hrs/week is counter productive (66)
- "Time is fixed, but energy flexes" (68)
- Personal energy is replenished by:
  1. Sleep
  2. Eat
  3. Move
  4. Connect
  5. Play: activity for its own sake, citing Churchill's *Painting as a Pastime*
  6. Reflect
  7. Unplug: don't think, talk, do, or read about work


# Part 2 - Cut

## Chapter 4 - Eliminate
- Time is zero sum but energy is not
- *What will I have to give up to say yes to this opportunity?* (96)
- How to say no:
  1. Yes - say yes to yourself by protecting what is important and affirming the other person
  2. No - say no to the request clearly and unambiguously
  3. Yes - affirm them and offer an alternative
- don't feel guilt or shame from the resulting free time by saying no (111)


## Chapter 5 - Automate
- first step is to notice what your automation needs are
- find the easier way to do things
1. **Self-automation**
  - Rituals liberate creativity, speed your work, and correct your mistakes (117-118)
  - Focus on these four key rituals: morning, startup, wind-down, bed
2. **Template automation**
  - Mindset: *what components of this project will I use again?*
  - Save email templates in your email signatures, which you can easily switch out when replying to messages
3. **Process automation**
  - Document, optimize, test, and share processes
4. **Tech automation**
  - Technology can be counted on, but individual tools cannot (129)
  - Email filtering software
  - Macro-processing software: Keyboard Maestro (Vimium, Shortcat, etc.)
  - Text-expansion software: TextExpander 
  - Screencast utilities: ScreenFlow, Camtasia


## Chapter 6 - Delegate
- Delegation process:
  - Decide what to delegate
  - Select the best person
  - Communicate the workflow
  - Provide the necessary resources
  - Specify the delegation level
- Five Levels of Delegation
  1. Do exactly what asked
  2. Research a topic and revert back to you
  3. Research, outline options, and make a recommendation
  4. Research, make a decision, execute, and update you later
  5. Do everything and no need to report back


# Part 3 - Act

## Chapter 7 - Consolidate
- Task switching is costly (cf Cal Newport), so batch (or MegaBatch) your work
- Front stage: tasks you are hired specifically to accomplish
  - There should be significant overlap between front stage and your desire zone
- Back stage: behind the scenes that enables front stage to happen
- Off stage: when you're not working
- Plan your ideal week
  - Batch your weekly activities by stage
  - Plan general *themes*: self, work, rejuvenation,
  - Place activities under those themes


## Chapter 8 - Designate
- **The Weekly Preview**
  - List your biggest wins
  - Review the prior week
  - Review your lists/notes to either: eliminate, schedule, prioritize, or defer tasks
  - Check goals, projects, events, meetings, deadlines
  - Designate your Weekly Big 3
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/master/reading/notes/2020-10-09-Free%20to%20Focus/images/192.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"></p>
- Spend 95% of your time on activities that are in quadrant's 1 and 2 of the Eisenhower Priority Matrix
- Evaluate if tasks are urgent and important to *you* (not someone else)
- **Daily Big 3**
  - The Pareto principle (80/20) applies to tasks
  - Writing out a dozen different tasks is a form of laziness
  - Complete your big 3 before noon

## Chapter 9 - Activate
- Minimize interruptions
  - Limit instant communication: turn off notifications, use Google voice to email for text
  - "an email inbox is like having a to-do list everyone in the world can populate" (211)
  - people will not respect your boundaries if you don't
- Uphill vs downhill tasks: the uphill tasks are what usually create value (214)
- Focus
  - technology like "Freedom"
  - music like "Focus@Will"
  - design your environment
  - declutter your workspace
  - increase your frustration tolerance
