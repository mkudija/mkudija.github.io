## Introduction
- this book answers: *what is so special about driving?*
- Crawford is concerned about the coming technocratic control of transportation taking away our freedom of movement, and critiques this from a Toquevillian perspective of coming together in a way that limits central power (10)

### Homo Moto
- movement and joy are connected, especially enhanced movement with machines (11)
- memory and movement are tied together (perhaps why we don’t remember our earliest childhood) (13)
  - he goes further to say that “the subjective coherence of a life seems to be built up from some basic *motor* capacities” (13)

### Motor Sports
- the self-loathing of the bourgeois and a life not lived: “the question to unasked and unanswered” (15)
- “There is a certain tonic effect in being scared shitless and trusting your skills to see you though.” (15)

### Folk Engineering: Rolling Your Own
- talks about the pleasure (and anxiety) that comes from building your own car, and the pleasure of sticking it to the state and bourgeoisie

### Trust and Solidarity
- book: *Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do* by Tom Vanderbilt (18)
- book: *The Long Haul* by Finn Murphy (19)
- the three modes of traffic management that will be discussed later: rule following (abuse of power), autonomous cars (massively expensive) , and human agency (meditation on self-government) (21-22)
- dystopian films: Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, WALL-E (22)

### Drivers as Moral Types
- a defense of lane splitting on motorcycles

### A Utopian Thought Experiment
- driving a light car for maneuverability and because you have more *skin in the game* (26)

### Sovereignty
- “Passion for driving cars...equips them to see just how bizarre and tyrannical a vision of progress may become when it seeks to remove the human element from every human activity.” (28-29)
- the new focus on *sovereignty* is “a reaction to the imperiousness of political elites and corporate forces in pressing agendas of progress that seek to delegitimize the concerns of those deemed regressive” (29)
- “The common thread among these discontents is their sense that they have come to be governed by elites whose allegiance is to their own transnational class, rather than to the common good of the particular nation they happen to reside in.” (30)
- “The technocrats and optimizers seek to make everything idiotproof, and pursue this by treating us like idiots...to drive us to exercise one’s skill at being free” (31)
- “Safetyism”: “If one cares about safety, one does well to take a skeptical look at the safety-industrial complex, and it’s reliance on moral intimidation to pursue ends other than safety” (34)
- “if left unchallenged, the pursuit of risk reduction tends to create a society based on an unrealistically low view of human capacities” (34)


## Cars and the Common Good
- Jane Jacob’s book (35): not just cars destroying cities, but urban planning )36)
- the growth of the automobile was largely a government (rather than private) understating, from FDR’s road projects through to Eisenhower’s interstate highway system (38-39)
- why is google making cars? “Self-driving cars must be understood as one more escalation in the war to claim and monetize every moment of life that might otherwise offer a bit of private head space” (40)
- commute like the rosary...the car’s isolation becomes a humanizing space in the world (41)
- “Futurism is a genre of myth making that seeks to generate a feeling of inevitability around some desired outcome, a picture that is offered *as though it were a prediction*” (42)
- Uber case study of growth at all costs without any hope of profitability resulting in massive misallocation of capital (44-45)


# Rolling Your Own

## Breaking Down: 1972 Jeepster Commando
- broke down near San Miguel in his Jeep Commando
- asking another human being to render aid was the hardest part (54)
- “when a situation looks grim, but also you’re not sure exactly how things stand, you form theories that are attractive not because they are the most plausible but because they give you something to *do*, and doing something is the only way not to be crushed by miasmic uncertainty and despair” (55)
- despair turned to freedom, and he sold his Jeep for a train ticket from Paso to Oakland 
- VW bus: “sometimes a car seems not simply to move you through the world, but to put you into the arms of the world more thoroughly.” (58)


## Project Rat Rot
- his wife is a cognitive psychologist who designed a car and taught rats to drive it
- Lambert: much depression caused by being disengaged from the basic tasks of our survival (64)
- taking care of ourselves lowers anxiety: human flourishing requires “open problem spaces” that elicit bodily and mental engagement (65)


## Old Cars: A Thorn in the Side of the Future
- this chapter: the false environmentalism of forced obsolescence, and creative possibilities from the old
- “patina lends proof of life” (67), Quoted from *Junkyards, Gearheads, and Rust* by Lucsko
- yard wealth and fixing old things as against the bourgeois virtue-signaling and planned obsolescence of the economy (71)
- litter and cultivated junk are opposites of stewardship, but viewed as the same by “civic responsibility” (73)
- “shoddiness is a natural corollary to our faith in progress” ...”nothing is made to outlast probable improvement” (73), and subsequent discussion of the mixed motives of cash for clunkers programs 
- “folk-classic” and the Hagerty persona (80)
- artistic hatred of the past, as expressed in pleasure at the destruction of old cars or the burning of Notre Dame (81)
- Michael Oakeshott’s view of conservatism as “affection for the present” and what actually exists (82), cf “On Being Conservative”, *Rationalism in Politics*
