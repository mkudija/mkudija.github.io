## Introduction
- this book answers: *what is so special about driving?*
- Crawford is concerned about the coming technocratic control of transportation taking away our freedom of movement, and critiques this from a Toquevillian perspective of coming together in a way that limits central power (10)

### Homo Moto
- movement and joy are connected, especially enhanced movement with machines (11)
- memory and movement are tied together (perhaps why we don’t remember our earliest childhood) (13)
  - he goes further to say that “the subjective coherence of a life seems to be built up from some basic *motor* capacities” (13)

### Motor Sports
- the self-loathing of the bourgeois and a life not lived: “the question to unasked and unanswered” (15)
- “There is a certain tonic effect in being scared shitless and trusting your skills to see you though.” (15)

### Folk Engineering: Rolling Your Own
- talks about the pleasure (and anxiety) that comes from building your own car, and the pleasure of sticking it to the state and bourgeoisie

### Trust and Solidarity
- book: *Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do* by Tom Vanderbilt (18)
- book: *The Long Haul* by Finn Murphy (19)
- the three modes of traffic management that will be discussed later: rule following (abuse of power), autonomous cars (massively expensive) , and human agency (meditation on self-government) (21-22)
- dystopian films: Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, WALL-E (22)

### Drivers as Moral Types
- a defense of lane splitting on motorcycles

### A Utopian Thought Experiment
- driving a light car for maneuverability and because you have more *skin in the game* (26)

### Sovereignty
- “Passion for driving cars...equips them to see just how bizarre and tyrannical a vision of progress may become when it seeks to remove the human element from every human activity.” (28-29)
- the new focus on *sovereignty* is “a reaction to the imperiousness of political elites and corporate forces in pressing agendas of progress that seek to delegitimize the concerns of those deemed regressive” (29)
- “The common thread among these discontents is their sense that they have come to be governed by elites whose allegiance is to their own transnational class, rather than to the common good of the particular nation they happen to reside in.” (30)
- “The technocrats and optimizers seek to make everything idiotproof, and pursue this by treating us like idiots...to drive us to exercise one’s skill at being free” (31)
- “Safetyism”: “If one cares about safety, one does well to take a skeptical look at the safety-industrial complex, and it’s reliance on moral intimidation to pursue ends other than safety” (34)
- “if left unchallenged, the pursuit of risk reduction tends to create a society based on an unrealistically low view of human capacities” (34)
