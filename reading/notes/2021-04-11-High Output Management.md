## Introduction
*1995*
- when attacked, lead with your strength (*x*)
- Global labor competition (all the more relevant with post-pandemic remote work): "If the world operates as one big market, every employee will compete with every person anywhere in the world who is capable of doing the same job." (*xi*)
- this book focused on Middle Managers and "Know-How Managers" (no direct reports) (*xiii*)
- His motto: *"Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos."* (*xv*)
- **Three ideas from this book** (*xv*):
  1. Output-oriented (*production*) approach to management 
  2. Managerial leverage:
    - *"The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence."* 
    - *"High managerial productivity depends largely on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage."*
  3. The Sports Analogy: give task-relevant feedback to elicit peak performance from individuals
- Managing your own career: Continually dedicate yourself to retaining your *individual* competitive advantage (*xviii+*)
  1. Are you adding real value?
  2. Are you plugged into what's happening around you?
  3. Are you trying new ideas/techniques/technologies 

## Forward
*2015 by Ben Horowitz* 
- Andy Grove:
  - is all substance (*xxii*)
  - balances the highest standards of clear thinking and performance with an undying belief in the underlying person (*xxvii*)
  - "In order to build anything great, you have to be an optimist, because by definition you are trying to do something that most people would consider impossible. Optimists most certainly do not listen to leading indicators of bad news." (*xxviii*)
- A manager's knowledge and skills only valuable if it gets more leverage from their team; all you can do is **motivate** and **train** (*xxiii+*)


# Part I: The Breakfast Factory

## Chapter 1: The Basics of Production
*Summary: Optimize a production flow by working backwards from the "limiting step"[^thegoal], and we can pull the levers of equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory against delivery time. Material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process so our goal with testing is to find issues as early as possible.*

[^thegoal]: aka "bottleneck" from [*The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement*](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=goldratt+the+goal&qid=1618307392&sr=8-3) by Eliyahu M. Goldratt

- Production flow: start with the *limiting step*, work your way backwards to previous steps with offsets (4)
- Three steps of a process: *process*, *assembly*, *test*
- You can pull the levers of equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory against delivery time, creating a "menu of options" with tradeoffs (i.e. you can create a continuous operation, but at the expense of flexibility) (10)
- Adding value: the material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process (12)
  - Therefore, test to detect and fix issues at the lowest-value stage possible

## Chapter 2: Managing the Breakfast Factory
*Summary: Use well-designed metrics to see inside the "black box" of production processes, a favorite being the stagger chart to create skin in the game for forecasters. Use variable inspection techniques to manage the quality of management processes, and increase productivity by growing **high-leverage** (high output per action) activities.*

- Indicators (KPIs) are a key tool: focus them on specific operational goals
  - Any measurement is better than none
  - Good indicators measure the *output* rather than the *activity*
  - Must be *measurable*
- Indicators allow us to see inside the "black box" (isolated inputs, outputs, and labor of processes)
- Helpful indicators
  - *Linearity indicator*: visually show actual progress vs required straight-line to hit target (21)
  - *Stagger chart*: show development of forecasts to create visibility of results and skin in the game for forecasters (23)
- Create an automated, standardized set of indicators to aid troubleshooting
- Exercise variable inspection as a manager: dig deeply into various activities to ensure all delegated activities are performed with thoroughness (33)
- Focus on *high-leverage activities*, those with high output per activity (35)
  - Automation
  - Work simplification
