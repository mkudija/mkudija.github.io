## Introduction
*1995*
- when attacked, lead with your strength (*x*)
- Global labor competition (all the more relevant with post-pandemic remote work): "If the world operates as one big market, every employee will compete with every person anywhere in the world who is capable of doing the same job." (*xi*)
- this book focused on Middle Managers and "Know-How Managers" (no direct reports) (*xiii*)
- His motto: *"Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos."* (*xv*)
- **Three ideas from this book** (*xv*):
  1. Output-oriented (*production*) approach to management 
  2. Managerial leverage:
    - *"The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence."* 
    - *"High managerial productivity depends largely on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage."*
  3. The Sports Analogy: give task-relevant feedback to elicit peak performance from individuals
- Managing your own career: Continually dedicate yourself to retaining your *individual* competitive advantage (*xviii+*)
  1. Are you adding real value?
  2. Are you plugged into what's happening around you?
  3. Are you trying new ideas/techniques/technologies 

## Forward
*2015 by Ben Horowitz* 
- Andy Grove:
  - is all substance (*xxii*)
  - balances the highest standards of clear thinking and performance with an undying belief in the underlying person (*xxvii*)
  - "In order to build anything great, you have to be an optimist, because by definition you are trying to do something that most people would consider impossible. Optimists most certainly do not listen to leading indicators of bad news." (*xxviii*)
- A manager's knowledge and skills only valuable if it gets more leverage from their team; all you can do is **motivate** and **train** (*xxiii+*)


# Part I: The Breakfast Factory

## Chapter 1: The Basics of Production
*Summary: Optimize a production flow by working backwards from the "limiting step"[^thegoal], and we can pull the levers of equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory against delivery time. Material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process so our goal with testing is to find issues as early as possible.*

[^thegoal]: aka "bottleneck" from [*The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement*](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=goldratt+the+goal&qid=1618307392&sr=8-3) by Eliyahu M. Goldratt

- Production flow: start with the *limiting step*, work your way backwards to previous steps with offsets (4)
- Three steps of a process: *process*, *assembly*, *test*
- You can pull the levers of equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory against delivery time, creating a "menu of options" with tradeoffs (i.e. you can create a continuous operation, but at the expense of flexibility) (10)
- Adding value: the material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process (12)
  - Therefore, test to detect and fix issues at the lowest-value stage possible

## Chapter 2: Managing the Breakfast Factory
*Summary: Use well-designed metrics to see inside the "black box" of production processes, a favorite being the stagger chart to create skin in the game for forecasters. Use variable inspection techniques to manage the quality of management processes, and increase productivity by growing **high-leverage** (high output per action) activities.*

- Indicators (KPIs) are a key tool: focus them on specific operational goals
  - Any measurement is better than none
  - Good indicators measure the *output* rather than the *activity*
  - Must be *measurable*
- Indicators allow us to see inside the "black box" (isolated inputs, outputs, and labor of processes)
- Helpful indicators
  - *Linearity indicator*: visually show actual progress vs required straight-line to hit target (21)
  - *Stagger chart*: show development of forecasts to create visibility of results and skin in the game for forecasters (23)
- Create an automated, standardized set of indicators to aid troubleshooting
- Exercise variable inspection as a manager: dig deeply into various activities to ensure all delegated activities are performed with thoroughness (33)
- Focus on *high-leverage activities*, those with high output per activity (35)
  - Automation
  - Work simplification


# Part II: Management Is a Team Game

## Chapter 3: Managerial Leverage
*Summary: A manager's output is that of his organization and those he influences. The art of management consists in identifying and performing the few actions that produce significant leverage. The single most important resource we allocate is our time.*

- Manager's output = output of his org + output of orgs he influences
- Business is a team activity: but *output* and *activity* are distinct
- "Like a housewife's, a manager's work is never done. There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done." --> so choose wisely how you spend your time and focus it on *high-leverage* activities (47)
- Some key managerial activities follow...
- **Information-gathering** consumes a lot of managerial time
  - Useful information comes from quick/casual interactions (how to supplement this with remote work...?)
  - Reports serve to communicate information, but more so to instill self-discipline
  - Information sources fall in a hierarchy (casual to formal) and should compliment one another and be redundant as a form of verification
- **Convey-information**
  - transmitting objectives and preferred approaches is key to delegation
- **Decision-making**
  - Information gathering is the base of decision making (and all other activities)
  - You won't make all decisions, but need to *nudge* others
- Being a **role model**
- **The single most important resource we allocate is our time.** (53)
- **Leverage** is the output generated by a given activity. High leverage is achieved when:
  - Your work impacts many people
  - Your work impacts another's activity over a long period of time
  - Your work supplies key knowledge to a larger group
- *Timeliness* drives leverage, particularly in planning
- *Meddling* and *waffling* create negative leverage
- **"The *art* of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them".** (58-59)
- "Managerial time has a hierarchy of values" (59)
- **Delegation** as leverage:
  - Both must share common information and approach to solving problems
  - It's ok to hold onto certain tasks you enjoy, but be honest with yourself and subordinates about that fact
  - Delegation without follow-through is abdication—you can't wash your hands
  - In general, you should delegate the activities you know best to aid in follow-through
  - Monitor the lowest-value stage of work (review early), and vary your level of review based on the subordinate's familiarity with the task
  - Objective is same as approval meetings: figure out how good the thinking is without having to do all the thinking yourself
- Use your **calendar** as a production-planning tool
  - Actively manage your calendar to fill holes between urgent activities with important but non-urgent activities
  - Say "no" to work beyond your capacity to handle
  - Batch similar tasks
  - Allow *slack* in your scheduling and carry an *inventory* of projects
- Minimize fire-drills: always be looking for sources of future high-priority troubles 
- Maintain an archive of information so you don't need to do ad hoc research every time a question is answered
- In all of this, impose a *patter* on your work to make is regular


## Chapter 4: Meetings—the Medium of Managerial Work
*Summary: Meetings are the medium through which managerial work is performed. Approach them with the required seriousness—ensure a meeting is a proper use of resources, prepare, take notes—and use them to increase your managerial leverage.*

- A meeting is the *medium* through which managerial work (gathering and supplying information, imparting the preferred method of action, making decisions) is performed (71)
- Four key types of meetings
  - **Process-oriented meetings**: regularly scheduled meetings for information exchange
    - **One-on-ones**: mutual teaching and exchange of information between supervisor and subordinate
      - Subordinate's level of task-relevant maturity and pace of change determines frequency of meeting 
      - It is the subordinate's meeting: prepare ahead of time (forces thinking), set the agenda and tone
      - Subordinate's focus is on flagging issues/concerns, supervisor's focus is on uncovering potential problems (*Principle of Didactic Management: ask one more question*)
      - Take notes during the meeting to organize thoughts and commit to actions (exchange afterwards if helpful)
      - Use a *hold file* to accumulate important but not urgent topics between meetings, then discuss in batch
      - Also provides a forum for heart-to-heart discussion
      - Can produce significant leverage for A) supervisor who can impact the subordinate's work between meetings, and B) subordinate who can influence peers by bringing issues to attention of their supervisor
      - Side note: can be a helpful model for family life also
    - **Staff meetings**: regular meeting with supervisor and all direct reports, providing opportunity for peers to engage
      - Learning is improved by listening to two people discuss who disagree on the matter
      - Have an agenda, but also open time
    - **Operation reviews**: forum for people who don't regularly interact to discuss issues
      - Should include formal presentation, reviewing manager sets the tone and is catalyst for discussion
  - **Mission-oriented Meetings**: ad hoc meetings to solve a particular problem
    - Chairman is the key person for calling the meeting, preparing, and ensuring a decision is reached
    - Consider the cost of a meeting and if an alternative can solve the problem. Have 8 people at most if a meeting is required
- Meetings aren't a waste of time, they are the medium through which we manage. But spending more that 25% of your time in ad hoc mission-oriented meetings indicates mismanagement.
