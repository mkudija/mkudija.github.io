# Chapter 1 - Quantified Selves

Interesting: 1970's Dr. Tabi Kahler's miniscript (process communication model) gives 6 primary personality types:
- Thinkers: view the world through data; deal with situations with logical analysis (1 in 4 people) 
- Rebels: react based on reactions; either love or hate things; innovative (1 in 5 people)
- Persistors: filter everything through their opinions; most politicians, a good quality for an astronaut (1 in 10 people)
- Harmonizers: deal with everything in terms of emotions and relationships (3 in 10 people)
- Promoters: view evertthing through action; salesmen of the world (1 in 20 people)
- Imaginers: deal in unfocused thought and imagination; spot patterns (1 in 10 people)

# Chapter 2 - The Match and the Spark
- Med school matching: "the stable marriage problem"
- dating sites and weird sex stuff(?)

# Chapter 3 - Do Algorithms Dream of Electric Laws
- classic NY crime cracking down on fare dodging in the subways...
- Minority Report: predict crime before it happens, and consequences
- opportunity to replace low-level laywers with algorithms

# Chapter 4 - The Machine that made Art
- hard to predict which movies will be successful: use neural networks
- Netflix generate content based on algorthmic predictions of what people want

# Conclusion
- cites Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the "Great Restructuring" of work
