# Deep Work by Cal Newport

* Those that win in the new economy are:
    * High Skilled workers - those that play well with complicated machines
    * Superstars - those who are at the very top of what they do 
    * Owners - those with access to capital
* Core abilities to thrive:
    * Ability to quickly master hard things
    * Ability to produce at an elite level in terms of quality and speed 
* Learning hard things takes deliberate practice 
    * Attention focused on the skill to develop
    * Receive feedback to keep attention on the most productive work
* There are three ways to find meaning in deep work:
    * Neurological - “management of attention is the most important thing for living a good life"
        * —> choose carefully and then give rapt attention: live a focused life
    * Psychological - deep work generates flow, and we are happier when we are immersed in something challenging
    * Philosophical - citing All Things Shining (and it’s observation that the enlightenment removed the sacredness from work), we need to refocus on the craftsmanship and sacredness of our work
        * the meaning uncovered is due to skill and appreciation of your work, not the outcome (the code is not noble, but the shaping can be)
* Rule 1 - Work Deeply
    * eudaimonia (Greek concept of the state where you achieve your full potential): eudaimonia machine is a conceptual building with 5 rooms, the last of which provides a protected place for deep work
    * you have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it —> need to add routines and rituals to minimize the amount of willpower we need to deploy
    * Decide on your Deep Work Philosophy
    * 1) Monastic Philosophy - maximize depth by eliminating or radically minimizing shallowness
        * single, well-defined goal as measure of success
    * 2) Bimodal Philosophy - divide your time into regular work, and dedicated (monastic-like) stretches of deep work
    * 3) Rhythmic Philosophy - chain method (do it every day, make it a routine)
        * Define a time for your work and stick to it every day
        * Early wake up time to go your work for 1-2 hours before your real job 
    * 4) Journalistic Philosophy - get away for any small bit you are able
    * Ritualize - where, how work, how support work (food/coffee) 
    * Make grand gestures - like Rowling renting hotel room to finish Harry Potter, a special setting can help put you in the right frame of mind; for me, old building or great library
    * Don’t work alone - hub and spoke model: access to both collaboration and isolation is important
    * Execute like a business - 4 Disciplines of Execution from Clayton Christensen
        * 1) Focus on what is wildly important - say yes to only the most important things
        * 2) Act on the lead measures - lead, not lag: hours of deep work
        * 3) Keep a compelling scoreboard - index card to track your hours of deep work
        * 4) Create a cadence of accountability - regular meetings to assess progress
    * Be Lazy
        * 1) Downtime aids insights - allow your unconscious brain to mull
        * 2) Downtime helps recharge for deep work - go for a walk, and when you disconnect from work you need to fully disconnect
        * 3) The work that evening downtime replaces is not important  - 
            * develop a “shutdown ritual” - review all your tasks at end of day, plan the next day, then shut down
*  Rule 2 - Embrace Boredom
    * 2 goals
        * improve ability to concentrate deeply
        * overcome desire for distraction
    * Take breaks from focus rather than distraction
        * schedule when you use the internet, then avoid it completely when not in those times
        * 1) This works even if your job needs lots of internet/email
            * amount of use doesn’t matter as much as discipline in avoiding when not supposed to
            * 5 minutes for email/internet every 15 minutes
        * 2) You must keep non-internet blocks completely free regardless of how you schedule
            * if you get stuck, either
                * a) switch to another offline activity
                * b) re-schedule internet block or now and adjust remaining schedule accordingly
        * 3) Schedule internet use at home as well
            * waiting and being bored is increasingly rare and increasingly valuable
    * Work like Teddy Roosevelt
        * Estimate time required, shorten the allowed duration, and work with high intensity to meet the objective
    * Productive meditation - use physical/non-mental time (walk, run, etc.) to think about a work problem
        * 1) Be wary of distractions/looping
        * 2) Structure your deep thinking
            * a) define relevant variables of your problem
            * b) define the next-step question to answer with those variables
            * c) review the answer for future use
    * Memorize a deck of cards
        * a side effect of memorizing is your ability to concentrate
        * a) walk through 5 room and remember 10 objects in each room
        * b) associate a memorable person/think with all types of cards
        * c) remember each person in each room to memorize a deck
* Rule 3 - Quit Social Media
    * need to evaluate both the benefits and the costs when choosing which tools to include in our lives
    * The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.
    * Apply the Law of the Vital Few to your Internet Habits
        * a) Identify the main goals in your personal/professional life
        * b) List the 2-3 most important activities to achieve that goal
        * c) If a tool contributes to these, only then should you use it
        * The Law of the Vital Few: 80-20 rule
    * Quit Social Media
        * ban yourself for 30 days - if still useful after that ban then reintroduce; otherwise delete
        * social media removes the connection between hard work producing content and people paying attention to you: I’ll pay attention to you if you pay attention to me even if neither of us really adds any value
    * Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself
        *  How to Live on 24 Hours a Day: see the time before/after work as a “day within a day"
        * put some thought into structuring your leisure time to give yourself a quality alternative to distraction during your leisure time
* Rule 4 - Drain the Shallows
    * Schedule Every Minute of Your Day
        * http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/
    * goal it not to stick to plan 100%, but to be thoughtful about how you spend your time
    * Quantify the Depth of Each Activity
        * Shallow work: noncoygnitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
        * How long would it take to train a smart recent college grad with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?
    * Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget
    * Finish Your Work by 5:30
        * fixed-schedule productivity: set a limit of fight hours a week and work backward to determine what rules and habits were needed to satisfy that constraint
    * Become Hard to Reach
        * Make people who send you email do more work
        * Do more work when you send or reply to emails
            * Determine the “project” represented by the email and find the most efficient process for concluding the project
        * Don’t respond
            * Tim Ferriss: “Develop the habit of letting small and things happen. If you don’t, you’ll never ind time for the life-changing big things."
* Winifred Gallagher: “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is."
