# [*After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/After-Virtue-Study-Moral-Theory/dp/0268035040/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=after+virtue&qid=1605726855&sr=8-1) by Alasdair MacIntyre

(Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981), 278


I first read *After Virtue* in a Morality & Modernity course taught by David Solomon at Notre Dame in the spring of 2011 to fulfill my second philosophy requirement. I enjoyed and [undeservedly] did well in the course without my mind in any way ready to really absorb MacIntyre's thought. I'm embarrassed to admit that after the course I sold the texts for the class, including *After Virtue*. I only bought a replacement copy a couple of years ago after other authors helped me see the full importance of what was wasted on me in my youth. Or perhaps not wasted, but simply a seed planted that has taken some time to germinate. I dug back in after reading Archbishop Chaput and am grateful for this reintroduction.

It's important to note that *After Virtue* is a first statement of the problem and a sketch of a possible solution but not the complete argument. MacIntyre says as much in the postscript to the Second Edition and prologue to the Third Edition, and the argument is further developed in his subsequent books which I plan to dive into eventually. 

*After Virtue* starts by observing the problem that modern moral arguments are irreconcilable in nature and shrill in tone. MacIntyre argues that this is the result of the failure of the enlightenment project of justifying morality by removing the teleological end man moves toward. This leaves us with an *emotivist* approach to questions of morality where the answer is all a matter of preference. People and traditions clearly have different preferences, so this leaves us deadlocked. MacIntyre argues that the path forward is a rearticulation of the classical Aristotelian and Thomistic Virtues. He concludes with a haunting comparison between our society and the Roman society at the Dark Ages and suggests that our hope rests in the emergence of a "new St. Benedict" and the formation of local communities where the virtues can be practiced in spite of the barbarians who now rule us.




## Preface
- moral philosophy isn't an "independent and isolable" area of enquiry (ix)


## Ch 1 - A Disquieting Suggestion
***Summary: MacIntyre opens by suggesting that morality is in a state of disorder, having been vibrant before collapsing and then being restored in a distorted way. This begs the question: what to do?***

- MacIntyre opens with an allusion to the world of *A Canticle For Liebowitz*: fragmented, misunderstanding, and subjectivist, and suggests that this is precisely the state of morality today (1-2)
- Morality flourished, then suffered catastrophe, then were restored but in a disordered way (3)


## Ch 2 - The Nature of Moral Disagreement Today
***Summary: MacIntyre observes that modern moral arguments are interminable and identifies the primary reason for this an Emotivist doctrine that holds all moral judgments to be merely expressions of personal preference.***

- moral utterance today expresses disagreements that are characteristically *interminable* (6); examples include: war, abortion, education & healthcare (6-7)
- common characteristics of these debates include (8+):
  - the arguments are logically valid but there is no way to rationally reconcile the premises
  - they are *impersonal*
  - they come from a variety of historical origins, often out of context and divorced from their original meaning (10)
- we are missing a *historical narrative* and hampered by the division of academic disciplines where moral philosophy is siloed (cf. James Turner's *Philology*) (11)
- **Emotivism**: "the doctrine that all evaluative judgments and more specifically all moral judgments are *nothing but* expressions of preference, expressions of attitude or feeling, insofar as they are moral or evaluative in character." (11-12)
  - The dominant modern theory to confront is emotivisim
  - Emotivism says that moral judgments cannot be resolved rationally
- But emotivism fails: (12+):
  - the subjective feelings/attitudes it is based on creates a circular reference
  - emotivism incorrectly removes the separation between expressions of personal preference and evaluative (including moral) expressions
  - emotivism obscures the distinction between [objective] *meaning* and [particular] *use*
- An emotivist is either the pinnacle of pretention, or unaware of exactly what they are doing: 
  - "people take themselves to be identifying the presence of a non-natural property...but there is in fact no such property and they are doing no more and no other than expressing their feelings and attitudes, disguising the expression of preference and whim by an interpretation of their own utterance and behavior which confers upon it an objectivity that id does not in fact possess." (17)
  - "Emotivism thus rests upon a claim that every attempt to provide a rational justification for an objective morality has in fact failed. It is a verdict upon the whole history of moral philosophy." (19)
  - "insofar as emotivism is justifiably believed, presumably the use of traditional and inherited moral language ought to be abandoned" (20)


## Ch 3 - Emotivism: Social Content and Social Context
***Summary: MacIntyre says a philosophy can't be understood apart from its social embodiment, and gives this view for emotivism through the lens of the emotivist characters.***

- the claims of a moral philosophy can't be understood apart from its social embodiment, so MacIntyre does this for emotivism (23)
- he focuses on the *Characters* as moral representatives of their culture (28), which include (30):
  - **The Rich Aesthete**: 
  - **The Manager**: manipulative social relations, transforms materials/investment into products/profit, treats the end as given and outside his scope
  - **The Therapist**: transforms people, also treats the end as given and outside his scope
- emotivism is only clear as the end product of historical change (35)


## Ch 4 - The Predecessor Culture and the Enlightenment Project of Justifying Morality
***Summary: We have to understand the history of philosophy to understand how we got here***

- we have to understand the history of philosophy to understand how we got here (36)
- discussion of Kierkegaard's *Enten-Eller* (39+)
- Kant's moral philosophy (43-44)
  - if moral rules are rational, they are the same for all rational beings
  - will to carry out these rules (not ability) is what matters
  - a conception of our happiness is not sufficient to ground morality

- The 3 Elements of a Rational, Functional Moral Culture (cf [AOM](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/modern-morality-shrill/)):
  - 1. Man-as-he-happens-to-be
  - 2. An ethical code that allows a man to move from state #1 to state #3
  - 3. A view of man-as-he-could-be-if-he-realized-his-telos
