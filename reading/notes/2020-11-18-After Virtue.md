# [*After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/After-Virtue-Study-Moral-Theory/dp/0268035040/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=after+virtue&qid=1605726855&sr=8-1) by Alasdair MacIntyre

(Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981), 278


I first read *After Virtue* in a Morality & Modernity course taught by David Solomon at Notre Dame in the spring of 2011 to fulfill my second philosophy requirement. I enjoyed and [undeservedly] did well in the course without my mind in any way ready to really absorb MacIntyre's thought. I'm embarassed to admit that after the course I sold the texts for the class, including *After Virtue*. I only bought a replacement copy a couple of years ago after other authors helped me see the full importance of what was wasted on me in my youth. Or perhaps not wasted, but simply a seed planted that has taken some time to germinate. I dug back in after reading Archibishop Chaput and am grateful for this reintroduction.

It's important to note that *After Virtue* is a first statement of the problem and a sketch of a possible solution but not the complete argument. MacIntyre says as much in the postscript to the Second Edition and prologue to the Third Edition, and the argument is further developed in his subsequent books which I plan to dive into eventually. 

*After Virtue* starts by observing the problem that modern moral arguments are irreconcilable in nature and shrill in tone. MacIntyre argues that this is the result of the failure of the enlighenment project of justifying morality by removing the teleological end man moves toward. This leaves us with an *emotivist* approach to questions of morality where the answer is all a matter of preference. People and traditions clearly have different preferences, so this leaves us deadlocked. MacIntyre argues that the path forward is a rearticulation of the classical Aristotelian and Thomistic Virtues. He concludes with a haunting comparison between our society and the Roman society at the Dark Ages and suggests that our hope rests in the emergence of a "new St. Benedict" and the formation of local communities where the virtues can be practiced in spite of the barbarians who now rule us.

We have all witnessed the problems MacIntyre identifies about interminable and irreconcilable moral arguments, and I have experienced these with friends and family on various topics. With two sons now the answer to these questions are all the more important.
