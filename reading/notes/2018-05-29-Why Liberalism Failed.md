# *Why Liberalism Failed* by Patrick J. Deneen

(New Yaven: Yale, 2018), 198

## Preface
- "...the better course lies not in any political revolution but in the patient encouragement of new forms of community that can serve as havens in our depersonalized political and economic order. As the Czech dissident Václav Havel wrote in "The Power of the Powerless": 'A better system will not automatically ensure a better life. In fact, the opposite is true: only by creating a better life can a better system be developed.'" (xv)

## Introduction

- Thesis: “Liberalism has failed—not because it fell short, but because it was true to itself…As Liberalism has become ‘more fully itself,’ as its inner logic has become more evident and its self-contradictions manifest, it has generated pathologies that are at once deformations of its claims yet realizations of its liberal ideology.” (3)
- All ideologies fail: “Among the few iron laws of politics, few seem more unbreakable than the ultimate unsustainability of ideology in politics. Ideology fails for two reasons—first, because it is based on falsehood about human nature, and hence can’t help but fail; and second, because as those falsehoods become more evident, the gap grows between what the ideology claims and the lived experience of human beings under its domain until the regime loses legitimacy. Either it enforces conformity to a lie it struggles to defend, or it collapses when the gap between claim and reality finally results in wholesale loss of belief among the populace.” (6)
- We see this especially in:
  - Politics: “The ‘limited government’ of liberalism today would provide jealousy and amazement from tyrants of old…” (7)
  - Economics: “The assumption by economic leaders seems to be that increased purchasing power of cheap goods will compensate for the absence of economic security and the division of the world into generational winners and losers…Material comforts are a ready salve for the discontents of the soul.” (9-10)
  - Education: 
    - “They accede in the duties demanded of them by their elders, but without joy or love—only with a keen sense of having no other choice.” (11)
    - Advanced liberalism is eliminating liberal education with keen intent and ferocity, finding it impractical both ideologically and economically.” (12)
    - Great texts: “are great not only or even because they were old but because they contain hard-won lessons on how humans learn to be free, especially free from the tyranny of their insatiable desires” (13)
  - Science: 
    - “We still hold the incoherent view that science can liberate us from limits while solving the attendant consequences of that project.” (15)
    - “What is supposed to allow us to transform our world is instead transforming us, making us into creatures to which many, if not most of us, have not given our ‘consent.’” (15)

- “statism enables individualism, individualism demands statism.” (17)
- his solution: 
  - “The only path to liberation from the inevitabilities and ungovernable forces that liberalism imposes is liberation from liberalism itself. Both main political options of our age must be understood as different sides of the same counterfeit coin.” (18)
  - "Its successes were always blank checks written against a future it trusted it could repair. Conservatism rightly observe that progressivism’s destination is a dead end, and progressivism rightly decries conservatism’s nostalgia for a time that cannot be restored.” (18-19 )
- “A better course will consist in smaller, local forms of resistance: practices more than theories, the building of resilient new cultures against the anti culture of liberalism.” (19-20)
- Quoting de Tocqueville: “What’s needed now is not to perfect our philosophy any further but to again do more honor to ourselves. Out of the fostering of new and better selves, porously invested in the fate of other selves—through the cultivation of cultures of community, care, self-sacrifice, and small-scale democracy—a better practice might arise, and from it, ultimately, perhaps a better theory than the failing project of liberalism.” (20)

## Chapter 1 - Unsustainable Liberalism
- the deepest commitement of liberalism is liberty, and this history (21+)
- three efforts guiding revolution of liberalism (24+)
  - Machiavelli: be realistic rather than focusing on virtue
  - Tradition and institutions are seen as oppressive rather than supporting >> individualism
  - Natural science to overcome the limits of nature
- "Among the greatest challenges facing humanity is the ability to survive progress." (29)
- Two anthropoligical assumptions orienting liberalism:
  - **Individualism and voluntarism**
    - Hobbes: only the state can create positive law, to secure our positive rights; relationships are based only on choice/"consent"/self-interest (32)
    - Locke: all relationships (even marraige/family) based only on choice, again serving self-interest rather than the community, created order, or God
    - Liberalism is not just descriptive, it is normative too: it encourages loose connections (34)
  - **Separation from and opposition to nature**
    - Bacon: rejected Aristotle and Thomas, saying we can "master" nature, even reversing the effects of the Fall (36)
    - "conservatives" want scientific and economic mastery of nature; "progressives" want any means of biologically "liberating" human beings
    - "Ironically, the more completely the sphere of autonomy is secured, the more comprehensive the state must become." (38)
    - Children viewed as a limitation upon individual freedom >> abortion on demand (39)
- Since liberalism is unsustainable taken to its logical conclusion...we face a choice: keep going down the path toward extreme license and extreme oppression, or accept self-limitation and self-governance


## Chapter 2 - Uniting Individualism and Statism
- despite apparent differences, left and right share two primary continutities (46-47): 
  - philosophical: the state plays a primary role in the expansion of individualism
  - practical and political: the project strengthens the state and individualism


## Chapter 3 - Liberalism as Anticulture
- liberalism uproots the underpinnings of culture (nature, time, place) and replaces them with false images (66)
- conquest of **nature**
  - liberalism views the base state of man as without culture, though Deneen cites the ancients in saying this isn't the case and culture (control of desires) helps us flourish
  - "The effect is at once to liberate humans from acknowledgement of nature's limits while rendering culture into wholly relativistic belief and practice, untethered from anything universal or enduring." (71)
- **time** (or timelessness)
  - we used to think of time as cyclical, but liberalism thinks of time as linear and cares less both for the past and for the future in an extreme form of presentism (74+)
  - "Culture educates us about our generational debts and obligations." (77)
- **place** (or placelessness)
  - for liberalism, our default condition is homelessness (78)
  - Wendell Berry: the constraints of place and community make family life possible (78-79)
