* Shared leadership vision of Fr. Hesburgh and Martin Luther King Jr.: “But the fact is, where others hesitate, leaders are already in motion. Leaders are casual about their accomplishments. For them, this really is no big deal” (136)
    * “The secret of leadership is that you must belong to something bigger than yourself.” -Fr. Ted, 137
* res ipsa loquitur - the thing speaks for itself; describing how there is always more to Fr. Link than you would originally think, not less
* “What Dean Link embodies is that you can do both. You can make money but also keep your personal integrity while you conduct yourself with the highest ethics” (155)
* “Too often we lose sight of just how much we have to be grateful for. And we must be grateful for our hardships. We must be more thankful for the hard days than we are for the days that are not as difficult. We should feel more gratitude since the hard days are our opportunities.” (161)
* “Who we are and what we have accomplished in our lives is not what will be discussed when we pass from life to afterlife. What will matter most of all are how many others we bring along with us to the gates of heaven.” (185)
* Link argues that we should legalize and regulate recreational drugs. This would remove them from the crime cycle, in which they are often used to hook a person in the drug culture where they will turn to crime to finance their use (237-238)
* suggested reading 269-272
