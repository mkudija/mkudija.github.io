11/9/14 - Finding True Happiness by Fulton Sheen
* “The more highly we regard ourselves, the more miserable we become; while the more lowly we regard ourselves in the light of God’s grace, the more content we become.” (11)
* “It is God you are looking for…No wonder everything short of God disappoints you.” (16)
* Three laws of pleasure (19-20)
    * Pleasure is like beauty; it i conditioned by contrast —> requires self-discipline
    * Pleasure is deepened when it has survived pain
    * Pleasure is a by-product, not the goal: pleasure comes only from the fulfillment of a duty or obedience to a law
* “There is an unmistakeable connection between an empty life and a hectic pace. To make progress the world must have action, but it must also know why it is acting, and that requires thought, contemplation, and silence.” (23)
* “silences prepares for action…love is preserved in silence” (24)
* “We cannot get a real satisfaction out of our work unless we pause, frequently, to ask ourselves why we are doing it, and whether its purpose is one [of which] our minds wholeheartedly approve. Perhaps one of the reasons why so many of our economic and political projects miscarry is because they are in the hands of men with eyes to tightly glued to what they are doing that they never stop to question whether it should be done at all. Merely keeping busy, merely getting paid, can never satisfy man’s need for creative work.” (28)
* “Humility is truth, or seeing ourselves as we really are…humility is the pathway to knowledge” (32)
* “The less knowledge we have of anything, the less significant it seems. Our hatred of a person often decreases as we learn to know him better.” (35)
* “Desire is to the soul what gravitation is to matter. When we know our desires, we know the direction our soul is taking. If desire is heavenly, we go upwards, if it is wholly earthly, we do downwards. Desire is like raw material out of which we fashion either our virtues or vices. As Our Lord said: ‘Where your treasure is, there your heart is also’ (Matthew 6:21).” (39)
* “Mediocrity is a sin against ourselves…the great joys of life are to be found in the recesses of a contrite, broken heart.” (45)
*  Causes of discontent: egotism, envy, covetousness, jealousy (67)
    * contentment is not found in a particular place (68)
* “Every cross in the world is tailor-made, custom-built, patterned to fit its bearer and no one else…” (76)
* “mopping an office for the love of God is ‘bigger’ than running the office for the love money.” (77)
* “You have freedom only to give it away. To whom do you give yours? You give it either to the moods, to the hour, to your egotism, to creatures, or to God.” (78)

9/6/14 - The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster 
* “And, since no one bothered to explain otherwise, he regarded the process of seeking knowledge as the greatest waste of time of all.” (9)
* “HAVE YOUR DESTINATION IN MIND” (14)
* “…Milo continued to think of all sorts of things…of how much could be accomplished with just a little thought.” (31)

8/23/14 - Saint Thomas Aquinas by G.K. Chesterton
* He starts with a comparison of Aquinas and Francis, emphasizing how while they are entirely different in style, the are both doing and seeking the same thing. This points to the beauty of catholic unity 
* Aquinas always wanted to be just a friar, not an abbot or monk or anything else, just a lowly, simple, humble friar
* “falsehood is never so false as when it is very nearly true.” (103)
* "A saint may be any kind of man, with an additinoal quality that is at once unique and universal. We might even say that the one thing which separates a saint from ordinary men is his readiness to be one iwth ordinary men...A saint is long past any desire for distinction; he is the only sort of superior man who has never been a superior person" (142)
* “we must either not argue with a man at all, or we must argue on his grounds and not ours” 108
* "The theology of a saint is simply the theism of a saint; or rather the theism of all saints. It is less individual, but it is much more intense" (166)
* ..........."and that there should in that sense beess difference between them in theology than in philosophy" (167) 
* “…that this labeling of Aquinas as a specialist was an obscure depreciation of him as a universalist. For that is a very common trick for the belittling of literary or scientific men.” (202)
* Anyone who thinks deeply will see that motion has about it an essential incompleteness…” —> this makes me think about resting with God, and how our inability to do so demonstrates our incompleteness

8/7/14 -Finding Darwin’s God by Kenneth R. Miller
* Note: this book does a great job 1) explaining evolution, seen in chapters 1-2; 2) defending the science of evolution against various attacks (including illogical religious ones), seen in chapter 3-5, and 3) beautifully connecting a scientific understanding of evolution with the Christian God, seen in chapters 7-9
* Chapter 1 - Darwin’s Apple (introduction)
* Chapter 2 - Eden’s Children (description of evolution)
    * Evolution’s 3-part mechanism: mutation, variation, natural selection (51)
    * discusses how our imagination is shaped by our experiences
* Chapter 3 - God the Charlatan (defending evolution 1: against scientific creationism, young-earth creationism)
* Chapter 4 - God the Magician (defending evolution 2: against intelligent design)
* Chapter 5 - God the Mechanic (defending evolution 3: against intelligent design at the bimolecular level)
* Chapter 6 - The Gods of Disbelief
* Chapter 7 - Beyond Materialism
    * the uncertainty of quantum mechanics in fact limits what science can know in principle (209)
    * “what critics of evolution consistently fail to see is that the very indeterminacy they misconstrue as randomness has to be, by any definition, a key feature of the mind of God.” (213)
    * “We need not ask if the nature of quantum physics proves the existence of a Supreme Being, which is certainly does not. Quantum physics does allow for it in an interesting way, and certainly excludes the possibility that we will ever gain a complete understanding of the details of nature. We have progressed so much in self-awareness and understanding that we now know there is a boundary around our ability to grasp reality. And we cannot say why it is there. But that does not make the boundary any less real, or any less consistent with the idea that it was the necessary handiwork of a Creator who fashioned it to allow us the freedom and independence necessary to make our acceptance or rejection of His love a genuinely free choice.” (213)
* Chapter 8 - The Road Back Home
    * “At this moment it seems as though science will never be able to raise the curtain on the mystery of creation. For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.” -Robert Jastrow (225)
    * “As a scientist, I know very well that the earth is billions of years old and that the appearance of living organisms was not sudden, but gradual. As a Christian, I believe that Genesis is a true account of the way in which God’s relationship with the world was formed. And as a human being,  I find value in both descriptions.” (257)
    * Augustine warned against literal interpretations of Genesis (258)
* Chapter 9 - Finding Darwin’s God
    * “Each and every increase in our understanding of the natural world should be a step towards God, and not, as many people assume, a step away. If faith and reason are both gifts from God, they they should play complementary, not conflicting roles in our struggle to understand the world around us.” (267)
    * “In biological terms, evolution is the only way a Creator could have made us the creatures we are-free beings in a world of authentic and meaningful moral and spiritual choices.” (291)

7/27/14 - Camerado, I Give You My Hand by Maura Poston Zagrans
* Shared leadership vision of Fr. Hesburgh and Martin Luther King Jr.: “But the fact is, where others hesitate, leaders are already in motion. Leaders are casual about their accomplishments. For them, this really is no big deal” (136)
    * “The secret of leadership is that you must belong to something bigger than yourself.” -Fr. Ted, 137
* res ipsa loquitur - the thing speaks for itself; describing how there is always more to Fr. Link than you would originally think, not less
* “What Dean Link embodies is that you can do both. You can make money but also keep your personal integrity while you conduct yourself with the highest ethics” (155)
* “Too often we lose sight of just how much we have to be grateful for. And we must be grateful for our hardships. We must be more thankful for the hard days than we are for the days that are not as difficult. We should feel more gratitude since the hard days are our opportunities.” (161)
* “Who we are and what we have accomplished in our lives is not what will be discussed when we pass from life to afterlife. What will matter most of all are how many others we bring along with us to the gates of heaven.” (185)
* Link argues that we should legalize and regulate recreational drugs. This would remove them from the crime cycle, in which they are often used to hook a person in the drug culture where they will turn to crime to finance their use (237-238)
* suggested reading 269-272

7/22/14 - Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down by J.E. Gordon
* Chapter 5 - Strain energy
    * emphasizes that knowledge of the strength of a material gives only partial insight into the structural integrity of a structure
    * strain energy is the area under the stress-strain curve —> larger requires larger energy to cause a structure to fail
* statues on top of cathedral buttresses add weight and keep the thrust line inside the wall to stabilize the structure (183)
* "A structure is a device which exists in order to delay some event which is energetically favorable" (324)
* “I think it is really important that some sort of view of the aesthetics of technology and engineering and structures should be put forward to engineers and technologists by one of themselves, however inadequate that view may be. For what follows I commit myself to Athena and to Apollo - by their grace may somebody more competent than myself be provoked into doing the job better.” (358)

6/9/14 - The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene
1. Never eclipse your superiors – Always reinforce their comfortable sense of superiority. They are probably acutely aware of their defects and incompetence, and alert to any threat from below. If you make them look bad, they will crush you, stymie you and make you miserable. Prove your usefulness. Never outshine them.
2. Do not trust allies, but understand the utility of enemies – Friends will betray you out of envy. They have a regrettable tendency to expect too much of you because of your friendship and to become demanding nuisances. Don’t hire or appoint friends. Hire enemies. The enemy whom you forgive will always feel that he has to prove his loyalty. If you have no enemies, get to work making a few good ones.
3. Don’t tip your hand – If people don’t know what goal you are seeking, they cannot defend against you. Keep your intentions secret. Move behind a smokescreen.
4. Spare your words – The powerful seldom speak. The more you talk, the more you expose yourself, and then, the more familiar you become. The more familiar you become, the less awesome you seem. Speak sparingly.
5. Protect your reputation – Reputation can defend you in any attack, but it is useless once damaged. Never tolerate or ignore any threat of a blemish to your reputation.
6. Make yourself the center of attention – People judge on the basis of what they see. They do not know what they don’t see. Forget toiling in obscurity. The only reward for that will be more toil and more obscurity. Make a spectacle of yourself.
7. Take credit for others’ work – Admittedly, it’s not nice to take all the credit for other people’s work, but it is very effective and you would be a fool to do otherwise. You will seem like a miracle of speed and competence, and no one will remember those who made your success possible, so they can’t threaten you.
8. Lure people – When you make other people move first, you are in control. Power means being in control. Never act first; never go to the other person’s turf. Make adversaries come to you. Bait them, entice them, seduce them, but draw them to you.
9. Win by deeds not by debate — Instead of arguing (which creates losers who bear grudges), win by acting. Prove that you are right by deeds, not by demonstrations
10. Shun losers; unhappiness and bad luck are contagious — The drowning man drags his rescuers under. Avoid losers. Hang with winners. Shun the poor, the unlucky, the unloved and the unhappy.
11. Make people need you – It is good to have people depend on you. Keep them dependent. Then, you are in control. Never teach them so much they can get by without you or compete with you. Keep a secret or two that maintains your power.
12. Tell part of the truth and be tactically generous – When you are honest and generous, people relax and begin to trust you. Then they are vulnerable and effectively in your power. Seem generous and honest. Give people gifts. Remember the story of the Trojan Horse: it worked admirably well.
13. When you ask for help, let people know what’s in it for them – Do not expect altruism. When people are altruistic (rare), you are in their debt. Usually, people will not want to help you for your sake. To get their support, appeal to their self-interest. If something will benefit them, exaggerate shamelessly; they will hasten to your aid.
14. Seem to be a friend to gather intelligence – Draw people out. Ask oblique questions. Get them to reveal themselves. Disarm rivals by seeming to be a friend.
15. Destroy your enemy – When you fight, do not leave your enemy alive to fight another day. Annihilate your enemies. Destroy them utterly. Even a small spark can start a forest fire. Drown every smoldering ember.
16. Absent yourself to inspire awe – When people see you too much, they do not respect you. Stay out of sight to inspire awe and perhaps fear. Scarce things are valuable.
17. Be unpredictable to inspire fear – If you are unpredictable, people will exhaust themselves trying to figure you out. In extreme cases, volatile changes of mood, temper or plan can empower you as a tyrant, allowing you to terrorize underlings.
18. Do not withdraw totally because isolation has its perils – It is one thing to make yourself scarce, another to hide behind the castle walls. You cannot trust anyone to bring you accurate information, so you cannot stay completely out of sight. Be out and about enough to know what is up.
19. Know with whom you deal; give no offense to the powerful – Be able to read people. Know what power and what friends your antagonists command. Make no assumptions. People often pretend to be what they are not, and may nourish a slight for years until they have a chance to repay it.
20. Make no promises – You are your only commitment. Avoid inseparable allies. As Washington advised, avoid entangling alliances.
21. Play dumb – There’s no point looking smarter than people. It puts them on their guard. Disarm your victims by making them feel smartest. They like it, and it makes them shed all suspicion and fear, so you can manipulate them as you please.
22. Surrender to gain power – If you are weaker than your opponent, forget staging a good fight for glory. Surrender on terms that let you keep as much power as possible. Wait for your opponent to make a false step, and strike from the dark, unsuspected.
23. Focus your strength – Pick one point and bring all your forces to bear on it. Do not disperse your energy or power. Cultivate one powerful mentor or patron assiduously.
24. Be courtly – The courtier is adept at intrigue, manipulation, image, flattery, flirtation and conversation. The perfect courtier looks good and manages to assemble power without seeming to grasp. To control even the king, be the perfect courtier.
25. Re-invent yourself – Don’t be what other people try to compel you to be. Carve out your own attention-getting identity. Be interesting, never dull. Be dramatic; have signature gestures, deeds, even costumes, so people always know who you are.
26. Don’t get your hands dirty – Use someone else to do any dirty work. Then, find someone else to take the blame. Scapegoats and cats’-paws have their uses.
27. Exploit people’s needs to build your cult – People want to believe. It hardly matters what or whom they believe. Offer them something to trust, someone to follow. Speak inspiringly and imply great promises, but spare the specifics so no one can charge you with not performing. Have your disciples sacrifice for you. They will empower you.
28. Act boldly – Never be timid. Take bold, decisive action. Any doubt on your part will impede you and increase the probability of failure. Never fail in public. The missteps of the bold are forgiven; the stumbles of the timid are not.
29. Plan everything – Leave nothing to chance. Plan every step, including the last step, and the one after that. Many have lost the fruit of their scheming by neglecting to plan the conclusion. As a result, the credit, money or power went to someone else.
30. Look as if everything you do is easy – Never show effort. Never break a sweat. Magicians conceal their stage apparatus and so should you. Amaze others with the ease of your accomplishment. Especially when you have run as far as you possibly can and are about to faint, seem to be full of energy and ready for another course.
31. You have to deal the cards to control the game – You must seem to allow others some freedom of choice, but always invisibly control the boundaries of their choices. Give them choices that make you better off no matter which alternative they pick.
32. Seem to offer what people have dreamed of and longed for – Never make people face the ugly truth. Give them the dreams they want and they will give you power.
33. Learn what hurts and use it – Everyone has a weakness, vulnerability, insecurity, need or sensitivity. Learn it and exploit it. Inflict or relieve pain as serves your purpose.
34. Play the king and people will treat you royally – Carry yourself like a king. Respect and value yourself. Other people will regard you as you regard yourself.
35. Timing is everything – The right act at the wrong time is the wrong act. The wrong act at the right time is the right act. Timing is everything. Part of appearing confident is the virtue of patience. Never seem hurried, harried or at loose ends. Behave as if everything is going your way and will work out in your favor.
36. Despise what is beyond your reach – Like Aesop’s fox and the sour grapes, if you cannot reach a coveted prize, despise it. If you acknowledge a problem or a problem person, you empower the problem or the troublemaker. If you seem to ignore and disdain what others covet or fear, you will seem superior, and they will be in awe.
37. Be spectacular – Do not hide your light. Use symbols, grand gestures, dramatic words and staging to highlight yourself and draw attention.
38. Think what you please, but act like the crowd – There is no advantage in playing the eccentric or the fool. If you seem to run too much against the current of the times and against the customary practice, people will distrust and despise you. Show your inventiveness and originality only to those with whom you are intimate.
39. Make a splash and you’ll fill your net with fish – Never get angry. Never give vent to strong emotions. Make your enemies do that. When they strike in anger, they will strike inaccurately, opening themselves to your patient, well-planned counter attack.
40. Don’t look for a free lunch; disdain it – Anything that seems free is not. Something worth having is worth the price. Pay your own way; carry your own weight. Owe nothing. Do not rely on the generosity of others; make others rely on yours.
41. Don’t try to fill the shoes of the great – If the shoes don’t fit you, you’ll stumble and look like a presumptuous fool. If the one who preceded you in a post was great, you will work in a shadow. Strike out on your own; show movement in a new direction.
42. Strike the shepherd to scatter the sheep – If the group is restive or truculent, look for the troublemaker. Often, a single malcontent can poison a whole community. Strike that one person and you will destroy an entire movement.
43. Win hearts and minds – Do not force people to do your will. They resent force and nurture dreams of revenge. Win them by guile, flattery and craft. Let them think they are following their own will and hearts. Then they will serve you out of love, and hope only to serve you more.
44. Enrage people by mirroring them – Do what your enemies do. Force them to face themselves. They will see themselves and they will not see you. You will enrage them, disarm them and defeat them.
45. Talk about reform but make changes slowly – People love to talk about change, but they hate to change. If you come to power, do not make big changes quickly. Talk up reform, inspire dreams of change, but make only small changes and work patiently.
46. Never look perfect – If you look too good, people will try to destroy you out of envy. Claim some fault so slight it is almost a virtue, but acknowledge it as a fault.
47. When you reach your goal, stop – Many have lost the prize by being too greedy or arrogant. Don’t overreach. When you achieve your victory, you have reached the end of your plan. Stop. Do not go farther until you have made a new plan.
48. Be protean – If you have no shape, people cannot find your center and cannot attack you. Be fluid. Adjust to every circumstance. Like water, adapt to every vessel.

    * “We ask this through Christ our Lord” —> pray through the Body of Christ
    * “Concrete community is a nonnegotiable element within the spiritual quest because, precisely, we are Christians not simply theists. God is not just in heaven, God is also on earth.” (98)
    * “A Christian spirituality is always as much about dealing with each other as it is about dealing with God.” (99)
* Chapter 6 - A Spirituality of Ecclesiology
    * The Church is the sarx the exzemed body of Christ
    * “catholic means universal, wide, all-encompassing. The opposite of a catholic is a fundamentalist, a person who has a heart with one room.” (130)
    * “…to be a member of the church is not to choose among these. It is to choose them all. Like our God in heaven, we too need a heart with many rooms.” (131)
    * Why I should go to church:
        * because it is not good to be alone
        * to take my rightful place humbly within the family of humanity
        * because God calls me there
        * to dispel my fantasies about myself
        * because ten thousand saints have told me so
        * to help others carry their pathologies and to have them help me carry mine
        * to dream with others
        * to practice for Heaven
        * for the pure joy of it, because it is Heaven!
* Chapter 7 - A Spirituality of Mystery
    * the Paschal Mystery is a cycle of rebirth
    * the various deaths within our lives
        * the death of our youth
        * the death of our wholeness
        * the death of our dreams 
        * the death of our honeymoons
        * the death of a certain idea of God and Church
    * we must let ourselves be blessed by the past
* Chapter 8 - A Spirituality of Justice and Peacemaking
    * “To change the world in such a way that people want justice and are willingly willing to live in a ways that makes justice possible requires an appeal to the heart that is so deep, so universal, and so moral that no person of good conscience can walk ways from it.” (174)
    * “In Jesus’ view, if you wish to find God, go look among the poor…conversely, he tells us that there are immense spiritual and psychological dangers in being rich and privileged.” (175)
    * the Lord’s Prayer for Justice (189-191)
* Chapter 9 - A Spirituality of Sexuality
    * “We will be happy in this life, deeding upon whether or not we have a healthy sexuality.” (193)
    * “Karl Jung once compared the incompleteness we feel in sexuality to the separated white and yolk of an egg. Together they make a one, a whole. Apart they are incomplete. The sexes are like that. Alone we are essentially incomplete and aching at every level for a wholeness that, at some dark level, we know we have been separated from. We experience ourselves as white or yolk, separated from our other half.” (194)
    * Sexuality vs. Genitality (194)
        * Sexuality is an all encompassing energy inside of us...
        * Genitality, having sex, is only one aspect of that larger reality of sexuality
        * “Having sex is admittedly not the whole reality of sex, but it is perhaps God’s greatest gift to the planet and it offers humans the opportunity for genuine intimacy available this side of eternity.” (195)
    * “Sexuality is not simply about finding a lover or even finding a friend. It is about overcoming separateness by giving life and blessing it. Thus, in is maturity, sexuality i about giving oneself over to community, friendship, family, service, creativity, humor, delight, and martyrdom so that, with God, we can help bring life into the world.” (198)
    * Nonnegotiable Christian principles about sexuality
        * Sex is sacred
        * Sex, by its very nature, must be linked to marriage, monogamy and a conventional commitment that is, by definition, all-embracing and permanent
        * Sex has an inner dynamic that, if followed faithfully, will lead its partners to sanctity
        * Sex always needs the protection of a healthy chastity (the appropriateness of any experience)
    * “In heaven…our sexuality will finally be able to embrace everyone.” (206)
    * “Solitude….is being alone, but it is being alone in such a way that our very incompleteness is a source of quiet strength and not of anxious dissipation.” (207)
    * Henri Nouwen’s four steps to turn restless incompleteness into restful solitude
        * Own your pain and incompleteness
        * Give up false messianic expectations
        * Go inward
        * It is a movement never made once and for all
    * “Among many other things, through his celibacy, Christ was trying to tell us that love and sex are not always the same thing, that chastity, waiting, and inconsummation have an important role to play within the interim eschatological age we live in, and that, ultimately, in our sexuality, we are meant to embrace everyone.” (209)
        * —> solidarity with the poor
    * “At the end of the day, given the scope and power inherent in our sexuality, what we really need from each other in deep relationships is precisely a confessor, someone before whom we can stop having to lie, someone before whom we do not have to try to measure up, and someone who can console us for the fact that we cannot disappoint him or her because, even at its best, the love we give each other is not enough. We are not gods and parts of us will always remain untouched, inconsummate, bursting with secrets kept silent for far too long.” (211)
* Chapter 10 - Sustaining Ourselves in the Spiritual Life
    * “To pray, I think, does not mean to think about God in contrast to thinking about other things, or to spend time with God instead of spending time with other people. Rather, it means to think and live in the presence of God. As soon as we begin to divide our thoughts about God and thoughts about people and events, we remove God from our daily life and put him into a pious little niche where we can think pious thoughts and experience pious feelings. ... Although it is important and even indispensable for the spiritual life to set apart time for God and God alone, prayer can only become unceasing prayer when all our thoughts -- beautiful or ugly, high or low, proud or shameful, sorrowful or joyful -- can be thought in the presence of God. ... Thus, converting our unceasing thinking into unceasing prayer moves us from a self-centred monologue to a God-centred dialogue.” - Henri Nouwen, Clowning in Rome
    * THE CORE OF A HEALTHY CHRISTIAN SPIRITUALITY
        * “Regular prayer (both private and communal), the practice of charity and self-sacrifice (bot hat home and in the wider world), some concrete involvement with the poor, involvement within some church community, and a willingness to be vulnerable for love (as Christ was vulnerable).” (215)
    * Commandements for the long haul
        * Be a mystic… 
            * we need a personal act of faith
            * personal faith depends upon prayer
                * “if you don’t pray, you will inevitable become depressed or inflated—or bounce back and forth between the two” (218)
            * prayer is pondering and carrying tension as Mary did
                * “Great joy depends upon first having carried great tension.” (221)
                * “Nobody will ever remain faithful in a marriage, a vocation, a friendship, a family, a job, or just to his or her own integrity without sometimes sweating blood in a garden.” (222)
        * Sin bravely…
            * be honest about our weaknesses
            * do not lie against the Holy Spirit (caution against sustained dishonest hand rationalization)
                * spiritual health is 90% about honesty
                * “If we are honest, eventually God, truth, and love will find us.” (230)
        * Gather ritually around the word and break bread…
        * Worship and serve the right God…

5/20/14 - Out of the Silent Planet by C.S. Lewis
* “‘I will tell you. He has left you tis one because a bent hnau can do more evil than a broken one. He has only bent you” (139)
* Warning against colonizing other worlds as a safety against destroying the earth, 139
* “But already it had become impossible to think of it as ‘space.’ Some moments of cold fear he had; but each time they were shorter and more quickly swallowed up in a sense of awe which made his personal fate seem wholly insignificant. He could not feel that stye were an island of life journeying through and abyss of death. He felt almost the opposite—that life was waiting outside the little iron egg-shell in which they rode, ready at any moment to break in, and that, if it killed them, it would kill them by excel of its vitality.” (146)
* think of heaven instead of space: “If we could even effect in one per cent of our readers a change-over from the conception of Space to the conception of Heaven, we should have made a beginning.” (154)

3/25/14 - The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith
* electronic version: http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/wealth-nations.pdf
* Book I - OF THE CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS OF LABOUR, AND OF THE ORDER AC- CORDING TO WHICH ITS PRODUCE IS NATURALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE PEOPLE.
    * Chapter I - THE DIVISION OF LABOR
        * pin-maker example --> what types of work are not amenable to division of labor? philosophy/theology where the connections between parts are necessary for deep insights?
        * if we argue division of labor (specialization) to an extreme end, we sacrifice the fulfillment/accomplishment of the individual for the success of the society/economy, where the individual does not understand what he is actually participating in
            * how do we order our creations that are so complex a single individual can't understand the essence of the whole (F-35, etc.)?
            * how do we maintain integrity among specialization?
        * ag ex: you can't specialize too much in ag --> technology is equally important
        * why division of labor increases production
            * increase in dexterity of the workman on the task
            * saving time between operations (--> saving mental energy between switching)
            * specialized tool for each operation (division of labor leads to development of machinery)
        * definition of philosophy: "philosophers, or men of speculation, whose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every thing, and who, upon that ac- count, are often capable of combining together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar objects in the progress of society" (15)
    * Chapter II - OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OC- CASION TO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR
        * Division of labour arises not from innate wisdom, but from humans' propensity to barter
        * "The difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much less than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labour.  The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education." (20) --> genius is developed, not innate
    * Chapter III - THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS LIM- ITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET
        * Limited opportunity for exchange discourages division of labour.
        * "There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can be carried on nowhere but in a great town." (21) --> ideal of urbanization? how is this balanced with the beauty of a quiet rural life?
        * sea travel opens markets
    * Chapter IV - OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY
        * every man is a merchant on some level --> need currency to avoid having surplus of things we won't need
        * metals are ideal for currency: easy to store, easy to divide without losing value, etc.
        * the term "value" has two meanings:
            * the utility of an object
            * the purchasing power of an object
        * mentions diamonds as having great value
    * Chapter V - OF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY
        * wealth is power over people's labor
        * distinguish between the value of different types and amounts of labor (32)
        * gold example explores the concept of supply and demand relation to price
        * labor real price - things given for it; labor nominal price - money given for it
        * "Labour, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well as the only accurate, measure of value, or the only standard by which we can compare the values of different commodities, at all times, and at all places." (36)
        * ***need to read end of Chapter V***
    * Chapter VI - OF THE COMPONENT PART OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES
        * all prices are resolved into three items
            * wages
            * rent of resources used to produce
            * "profits of stock" - compensation for capital risk
    * Chapter VII - OF THE NATURAL AND MARKET PRICE OF COMMODITIES
        * when demand exceeds supply, the price goes up; when the supply exceeds demand, the price goes down
        * discusses the importance of information in the market (and keeping information guarded)
    * Chapter VIII - OF THE WAGES OF LABOUR
        * observes that the price of labor follows the laws of supply and demand, with the exception of collusion among laborers or masters
        * "Labour is the real exchange for commodities".
        * "whose interests are by no means the same" (60) --> agency and incentives
        * "A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occa- sions be somewhat more, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation." (61) --> CST
* Book IV - OF SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
    * Chapter I - OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMERCIAL OR MERCANTILE SYSTEM
        * makes argument against protectionist tariffs and large gold reserve

1/31/14 - The God of Jesus Christ by Joseph Ratzinger
* God
    * God has names
        * we are Vikings in spaceflight (15)
        * by attempting to take all the power (by virtue of science, etc.) we eliminate the need for God (16)
        * knowing God is not just theoretical, but also depends on relationship (17)
        * "he knows that he is known" (18)
        * "It is impossible to separate the question of whether God exists from the question of who or what God is" (19)
        * we cannot know God in our hearts if they are either selfish and full of desire or inattentive (21)
        * "His name is a mystery" (22)
        * "Eternity is not the past.  It is this absolute reliability and constancy that always bears us up.  God 'is'" (22)
        * "He has a face, and he seeks our face.  He has a heart, and he seeks our heart" (24)
    * God is three and God is one
        * we renew our baptism by making the sign of the cross (26)
        * "The primary concern in Christianity is, not the Church or man, but God.  Christianity is not orientated to our own hopes, fears, and needs, but to God, to his sovereignty and power.  The first proposition of the Christian faith and the fundamental orientation of Christian conversion is: 'God is'" (27)
        * "God is--and, therefore, that which is true and right is superior to all our goals and interests" (28)
        * "God is--and this also means that all of us are his creatures.  Only creatures, indeed; but precisely because we are creatures, we have our true origin in God" (28)
        * awesome discussion of fatherhood 29+
        * discussion of the image of God 30+
        * "In [Christ's] prayer, he plunges the totality of his life into the abyss of truth and of goodness that is God" (33)
        * "Prayer was the center out of which he lived, and it was prayer that showed him how to understand God, the world, and men.  To follow Jesus means looking at the world with the eyes of God and living accordingly…In Jesus' prayer, the inner life of God becomes visible to us: we see how God himself is.  Faith in the triune God is nothing other than the exposition of what takes place in Jesus' prayer.  In his prayer, the Trinity is revealed" (33-34)
    * The Creator God
        * "Christian faith concerns the whole of reality" (38)
        * why we study theology (39)
        * "Faith makes technical research and questioning possible, because it explains the rational character of the world and the orientation of the world toward man; but it is profoundly opposed to restricting thought exclusively to questions of function and usefulness.  Faith challenges man to look beyond immediate usefulness and to ask about the foundations of th totality of things.  Faith protects the contemplative and listening reason from attack by the merely instrumental reason" (41)
        * "Conscience is higher than the law" (48)
    * Job's question
        * "Man is God's image--and only man" (49)
        * "This humble act of falling silent as the first step of wisdom should concern us, too" (52)
        * "God's compassion has flesh" (53)
* Jesus Christ
    * Descendit de caelis--He came down from heaven "…and became man"
        * "Essentially, the Son is the release and handing back of himself--that is what sonship means" (67)
    * "…and became man"
        * "It is in "being a child" that the very essence of what it is to be a man is realized, so much so that one who has lost the essence of childhood is himself lost" (71)
        * sonship means being oriented to the Father (72)
        * "Man wishes to be God and this is indeed his destiny" (72-73)
        * discussion of childhood (73)
        * "loneliness of being misunderstood" (79) --> is this one of my greatest fears?
    * Consubstantial with the Father
        * we must be like fishermen, not like philosophers (86)
        * "God can be known only through God" (90)
    * Risen from the dead in accordance with scripture
        * we have both a "narrative tradition" and "confessional tradition" of the Resurrection
        * "Jesus after the Resurrection belongs to a sphere of reality that is normally inaccessible to our senses" (98)
* The Holy Spirit
    * sin glossa --> live Sacred scripture (108)
    * "One cannot display the Spirit of God as one displays goods for sale in a ship.  He can be seen only by the one who bears him within himself" (110
