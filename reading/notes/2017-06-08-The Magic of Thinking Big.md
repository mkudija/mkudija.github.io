# The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. Schwartz

* Chapter 1 - Believe you can succeed and you will
    * Your mind is a thought factory: Mr. Triumph vs. Mr. Defeat
    * Think success instead of failure
    * Remind yourself that you are better than you think you are
    * Believe big (you won’t accomplish less than you set out to)
* Chapter 2 - Cure yourself of Excusitis
    * “My health isn’t good” -> 
        * Refuse to talk about your health
        * Refuse to worry about your health
        * Be grateful that your health is as good as it is
    * “I’m not smart enough” ->
        * Don’t underestimate your intelligence and overestimate that of others
        * Remind yourself “my attitudes are more important than my intelligence”
        * Thinking is more valuable than memorizing facts
    * “I’m too old/young” ->
        * Look at your present age positively
        * Compute how much productive time you have left
        * Invest future time in doing what you really want to do
    * “I have bad luck” -> 
        * Accept the law of cause and effect
        * Don’t be a wishful thinker
* Chapter 3 - Build confidence and destroy fear
    * Action cures fear: 
        * Isolate your fear and determine exactly what you are afraid of
        * Then take action against that exact reason for fear
    * Self-confidence: Deposit only positive thoughts into your memory bank, and withdraw only positive thoughts
    * Put others in perspective
        * Get a balanced view of others: they are important, but so are you
        * Develop an understanding attitude

    * Throw thought-poison out of your environment
    * Go first class in everything you do
* Chapter 8 - Make your attitudes your allies
    * Results come with enthusiasm, so grow your “I’m activated” attitude:
        * If you’re not interested in something, learn more about it
        * Act alive
        * Broadcast good news
    * People do more for you when you make them feel important
