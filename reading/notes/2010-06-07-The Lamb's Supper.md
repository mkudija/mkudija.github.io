# *The Lamb's Supper* by Scott Hahn

- Melchizedek - Gen 14:18, Heb 7:1 (16).
- Read Psalm 22 - "Why have you forsaken me" ultimately ends in salvation (33).
- When making the sign of the cross, three fingers together represent the trinity and the two fingers together represent the humanity and divinity of Christ (44).
- "Making the Sign of the Cross, then, is like swearing on the Bible in a court of law" (45).
- Does the reference to "daily bread" in the Our Father suggest daily mass attendance? (55).
- "The Church teaches that Mary was perpetually virgin" (79).
- Each church has a guardian angel (86).  >> Does each chapel at ND have a guardian angel?
- "In Revelation (14:4), we also encounter a large number or men consecrated to virginity" (88).  >> Deaconate or priesthood?
- "This is what was unveiled in the Book of Revelation: the union of heaven and earth, consummated in the Holy Eucharist" (125).
- "Those are the tough battles...Bu because they're so perfectly hidden, so interior, they require greater heroism" (144).
