2018-03-23

*From Mom/Jayne*

An exploration of Taoist philosophy through the lens of Winnie-the-Pooh:

# The How of Pooh? (p. 1)
- "The Vinegar Tasters"
  - **Confucianism**: the world is imperfect and needs to be ordered by humans
  - **Buddhism**: the world is suffereing and should be rejected
  - **Taoism**: the world is harmonious to be embraced and enjoyed
  - ...not stated, but **Christianity**: I was made for something other than this world


# The Tao of Who? (p. 9)
- The **uncarved block**: 
  - things as they naturally are
  - be open to experiences but unburdened by them
  - don't let analysis prevent experience

# Spelling Tuesday (p. 23)
- Value experience over knowledge 
- Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is meaningless

# Cottleston Pie (p. 37)
- Accept things as they are
- Everything has a natural purpose
- The first thing you need to do is recognize your "own inner nature" (sounds a bit like "authenticity")

# The Pooh Way (p. 67)
- Wu Wei: “doing without meddlesome, combative, or egotistical effort”
- Story of the honey pot gift: work with the natural order of things 

# Bisy Backson (p. 91)
- Bisy Backson = Type A: always need to be productive
- Enjoy the present rather than always thinking about the future

# That Sort of Bear (p. 115)
- Everything has its own unique value and nothing has greater inherent value than anything else (a bit relativistic)

# Nowhere and Nothing (p. 141)
- cease to impose your will on the world
- allow the empty mind to work
