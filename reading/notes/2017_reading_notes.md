* “Often when he was teaching me to write in Greek the Fox would say, “Child, to say the very thing you really mean, the whole of it, nothing more or less or other than what you really mean; that’s the whole art and joy of words.” A Glib saying. When the time comes to you at which you will be forced at last to utter the speech which has lain at the center of your should for years, which you have, all that time, idiot-like, been saying over and over, you’ll not talk about joy of words. I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?” (294)

7/25/17 - Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow
* “Hamilton was the supreme double threat among the founding fathers, at once thinker and doer, sparking theoretician and masterful executive” (4).
* A great overview of Hamilton’s life from the prologue: “The magnitude of Hamilton’s feats as treasury secretary has overshadowed many other facets of his life: clerk, college student, youthful poet, essayist, artillery captain, wartime adjutant to Washington, battlefield hero, congressman, abolitionist, Bank of New York founder, state assemblyman, member of the Constitutional Convention and New York Ratifying Convention, orator, lawyer, polemicist, educator, patron saint of the New-York Evening Post, foreign-policy theorist, and major general in the army. Boldly uncompromising, he served as catalyst for the emergence of the first political parties and as the intellectual fountainhead for one of them, the Federalists. He was a pivotal force in four consecutive presidential elections and defined much of America’s political agenda during the Washington and Adams administrations, leaving copious commentary on virtually every salient issue of the day” (5)
* “Hamilton was the messenger from a future that we now inhabit…Today, we are indisputably the heirs to Hamilton’s America, and to repudiate his legacy is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world” (6)
* George Washington: “With me it has always been a maxim rather to let my designs appear from my works than by my expressions.” (89)
* "While on Washington's staff, he filled up 120 pages of notes from his extracurricular reading. Hamilton fit the type of self-improving autodidact, employing all his spare time to better himself. He aspired to the eighteenth century aristocratic ideal of the versatile man conversant in every area of knowledge…While other Americans dreamed of a brand-new society that would expunge all traces of effete European civilization, Hamilton humbly studied those societies for cues to the formation of a new government” (110)
* "The first great skeptic of American exceptionalism, he refused to believe that the country was except from the sober lessons of history” (627)
* "Only once did Burr betray any misgivings about killing Hamilton. While reading the scene in Lawrence Sterne's Tristram Shandy in which where the tenderhearted Uncle Toby picks up a fly and delicately places it outside a window instead of killing it, Burr is said to have remarked, ‘Had I read Sterne more and Voltaire less, I should have known the world was wide enough for Hamilton and me.’” 
* 
* Words:
    * effete (adj.)

7/24/17 - Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad
* “What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth!… The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires” (2)
* “The yearns of seamen have a direct simplicity” (3).
* “They were men enough to face the darkness” (4).
* “They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force—nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others” (4). i.e. your strength is not of your accord, but a gift or luck
* “‘I don’t want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,’ he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to hear” (5). i.e. tell about you, since you are interesting
* “It’s queer how out of touch with truth women are” (10)
* “I don’t like work - no man does - but I like what is in the work, the chance to find yourself. Your own reality - for yourself, not for others - what no other man can even know” (25)
* “It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly. It’s really easier to face bereavement, dishonor, and the perdition of one’s soul - than this kind of prolonged hunger” (38)
* “I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary” (65)
* “They trespass upon my thoughts” (66)
* Words
    * diaphanous (adj) Light, delicate, and translucent: “The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds” (2).
    * trireme (noun)  An ancient Greek or Roman war galley with three banks of oars

7/19/17 - Writing to Learn by William Zinsser
* Preface
    * he is a “generalist in a land that prefers narrow expertise” (viii)
    * “We write to find out what we know and what w want to say. I thought of how often as a writer I had made clear to myself some subject I had previously known nothing about by just putting one sentence after another-by reasoning my way in sequential steps to its meaning..writing and thinking and learning were the same process” (viii-ix)
    * 

7/10/17 - Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer
* I agree that readers are often poorly served when an author writes as an act of catharsis, (pg. Location: 154)
* Waugh bestowed the name Mount Everest on Peak XV, in honor of Sir George Everest, his predecessor as surveyor general. (pg. 13)
* Mallory, whose name is inextricably linked to Everest, was the driving force behind the first three expeditions to the peak. While on a lantern-slide lecture tour of the United States, it was he who so notoriously quipped “Because it is there” when an irritating newspaperman demanded to know why he wanted to climb Everest. (pg. 15)
* While tentbound high on Everest, Mallory and his companions would read aloud to one another from Hamlet and King Lear. (pg. 16)
* ked across the tarmac of Tribhuvan International Airport and climbed aboard a Russian-built Mi-17 helicopter operated by Asian Airlines. A dented relic of the Afghan war, it was as big as a school bus, seated twenty-six passengers, and looked like it had been riveted together in somebody’s backyard. The flight engineer latched the door and handed out wads of cotton to stuff in our ears, and the behemoth chopper lumbered into the air with a head-splitting roar. (pg. 42)
* At 20,500 feet, the altitude was deemed too high for safe evacuation by helicopter—the air was too insubstantial to provide much lift for a helicopter’s rotors, making landing, taking off, or merely hovering unreasonably hazardous—so he would have to be carried 3,000 vertical feet to Base Camp down the Khumbu Icefall, some of the steepest, most treacherous ground on the entire mountain. Getting Tenzing down alive would require a massive effort. (pg. 65)
* I quickly came to understand that climbing Everest was primarily about enduring pain. And in subjecting ourselves to week after week of toil, tedium, and suffering, it struck me that most of us were probably seeking, above all else, something like a state of grace. (pg. 170)
* Whatever motivated him, Lopsang’s decision to tow a client didn’t seem like a particularly serious mistake at the time. But it would end up being one of many little things—a slow accrual, compounding steadily and imperceptibly toward critical mass. (pg. 218)
* Breashears, who had worked around many helicopters during the course of a long and distinguished film career, immediately found a landing pad bordered by two gaping crevasses at 19,860 feet. I tied a silk kata to a bamboo wand to serve as a wind indicator, while Breashears—using a bottle of red Kool-Aid as dye—marked a giant X in the snow at the center of the landing zone. A few minutes later Makalu Gau appeared having been dragged down the glacier on a piece of plastic by a half-dozen Sherpas. A moment after that we heard the THWOCK-THWOCK-THWOCK of a helicopter’s rotors thrashing furiously at the thin air. Piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Madan Khatri Chhetri of the Nepalese army, the olive-drab B2 Squirrel helicopter—stripped of all unnecessary fuel and equipment—made two passes, but on each occasion aborted at the last moment. On Madan’s third attempt, however, he settled the Squirrel shakily onto the glacier with its tail hanging over a bottomless crevasse. Keeping the rotors revving at full power, never taking his eyes off the control panel, Madan raised a single finger, indicating that he could take only one passenger; at this altitude, any additional weight might cause him to crash while taking off. (pg. 329)

7/4/17 - On Writing by Stephen King
* Some levels in your writing toolbox:
    * Vocabulary - use the first word that comes to mind (not a more complicated one)
    * Grammar - if you don’t know, it’s too late. “Grammar is not just a pain in the ass, it’s the pole you grab to get your thoughts up on their feed and walking”
    * Do not use the passive voice, and “the road to hell is paved with adverbs”
    * Paragraphs are almost as important for how they look as what they say: they are maps of intent
* If you want to be a writer, you must read a lot and write a lot
* We read to:
    * see the band and know what we shouldn’t do
    * See the good and measure ourselves against the great
    * See different styles
* **Write 1000 words a day 6 days a week
* Write only for yourself and the Ideal Person (your first reader) who will read it first
    * Write with the door closed

* "Writing is the water of life, so doing, drink and be filled up"


6/22/17 - Salary Tutor by Jim Hopkinson
Salary Negotiation for new job
* At the end of your salary negotiation, you want to be able to answer yes to these two questions:
    * Was I prepared?
    * Did I do everything I could?
* Step 1 - Do Your Homework
    * you need to know the salary range for the job with someone of your skills
    * use personal networking and online research
* Step 2 - Network
    * 80% of jobs come from networking
* Step 3 - Prepare your IRS Document (Industry Research of Salaries)
    * Ranges: Current | Lowest You Would Accept < Target Range < Target | Best case
    * see pg. 41 for format
* Step 4 - Don’t Get Eliminated
    * defer all salary discussion until you are wanted for the job
* Step 5 - Navigating the First Interview
    * never state a figure first
    * never state your salary, if asked say:
        * “How much am I making now? [mirror] I’m sorry, but the employment contract I’m under with my current employer does not allow me to reveal my compensation. However, I’m sure that when the time comes to discuss salary, we won’t have a problem settling on a fair number.”
        * “So i’m not sure if there’s a direct correlation between what I was making there and what my value would be at this current position. I’d like to keep learning more about what the responsibilities here would be.”
* Step 6 - The No Win Question
    * If you get offer over phone, say thank you and you will get back to them
    * If they offer you the job but ask salary, still let them state a number first: whoever gives their number first has the most to lose
* Step 7 - “Right Back At Ya” Method
    * First time the ask you for range:
        * “Well I did some research into the general range for a position like this, but it was clear to me that it could vary widely based on the company. What type of range did you have budgeted for the position.”
    * They push back:
        * "Well, I’ve done some research, and I clearly think that the skills that I would bring to this job will make it worth your while, but you’re in the best position to determine what a company like yours values for a position like this. What kind of range is ABC Corp. comfortable with?"
    * If they still push back, give them “Crazy range”
        * “Based on my research, the salary range for a position like this varies greatly depending on the company, the responsibilities, etc…paying anywhere from $50k up to $100k or more
* Step 8 - 30 seconds to glory
    * If they give you a range (90-100k), say this:
        * "$100k. Hmm….[pause]”
        * Think about what working at that company for that salary would be like. Hold the silence.
    * If they start to move at all:
        * Nod your head, keep thinking, and keep silent
* Step 9 - According to my research
    * Assuming they give you a range and make an offer:
        * “I appreciate the generous offer, and I’m excited about the position. But I’ve don’t a lot of homework in preparation and according to my analysis…”
        * Pull out your IRS document for the appropriate range
        * “For this position, the typical salary range is between x and y with an average of $76,544. Based on my responsibilities we talked about (x, y, and z) and the fact that I have (x, y and z) experience, I feel that I should be at the higher end of this scale. Is that something you can consider?”
* Step 10 - Take ‘em for all they’re worth
    * make sure to negotiate all the other parts of the offer, which my be more flexible
* Accepting the Job Offer
    * It’s important that both parties feel like they won

Get a raise in your Current Job
* You don’t necessarily need to leave your job to get a large pay increase
* It is much more difficult and expensive for your employer to find and train a replacement than keep you happy
* You have to earn a raise, by doing one of the following:
    * make the company money
    * save the company money
    * do a job no one else can do
* Not reasons you deserve a raise
    * having a baby….
* Step 1 - Lay the groundwork
    * maintain a simple list that documents your accomplishments
        * for me, combination of my review notes, and affirmation page
* Step 2 - Learn the system
* Step 3 - Decide on timing
    * find out when budgets are timed and plan accordingly
* Step 4 - Get notice and increase communication
    * involvement in anything that will raise your profile is a good idea
    * when review near, go a little “cc” to take advantage of the recency effect
* Step 5 - Set a date
    * mention causally that you’re going over your goals for the next six months and you’d like to discuss your next steps at the company
    * send an email invite a couple weeks out, note which times are least hectic for your boss
* Step 6 - Know their style
    * know their style and be able to present to them in a way that works: your accomplishments, your value to the company, your goals, what you’re asking for in return
* Step 7 - Know your options
    * “one salmon I used to work with goes on at least one interview every six months, even if he’s happy in his current job to make sure he know his current worth, find out what skills are most valuable in his field, and has potential ‘escape routes’ should something come up at his current job”
* Step 8 - Having the right mind-set
    * focus on the fact that you have added value to the company and the company should compensate you for what you’ve contributed
* Step 9 - Make your case
    * Off the cuff
        * focus on effort (quantity and quality) and results
        * don’t make excuses or complain
        * give data to support your case
        * show that you’re aligned with company goals
    * Supporting documentation
        * bring a document, similar to resume, listing accomplishments with numbers
        * share a story of the intangible qualities you have to help your manager justify a raise
    * Digital portfolio
        * give a visually-compelling way for your supervisor to see your accomplishments
        * know your audience and know what the best platform would be
* Step 10 - Keep your cool
    * be ready with a range you would be willing to accept
    * practice “right back at ya”
    * use silent response
    * ask for time to think over their offer if needed
    * don’t give ultimatum, but pressure for date when it can be settled
    * send email thanking for discussion and set reminder for follow-up
    * keep your cool when you get a response
        * if you don’t get what you want, listen and try to glean more information

Negotiation salary in a bad economy
* know the situation
* it’s all about the money - put yourself in the position where you are directly improving net income
* set the stage for recovery - sit down and explain that even if they can’t give you a raise you deserve one; ask for a higher title and review in six months
* What it says about you - shows that you are forward thinking and aware of what’s going on in the business

Another chapter on freelance negotiations that I didn’t take notes on


6/21/17 - Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss
* Chapter 1 - 
    * Ask open ended ("calibrated") questions: buys you time and gives them the sense of control
    * Negotiation can be overly rational and formulaic: we need to keep in mind that we are people and have emotions 
        * Use Kahneman's understanding of our two types of thinking
    * Use tactical empathy to gain access to the mind of the other
* Chapter 2 - Mirroring 
    * Your most powerful tool in verbal communication is your voice
    * Mirroring (isopraxism), is imitation to establish rapport and lead to trust - we trust what is alike us
        * Repeat the last 3 words (or one important word) they said
    * Mirroring allows you to disagree without being disagreeable
    * The intention behind mirrors should always be "please help me understand"
    * Lessons from this chapter
        * A great negotiator uses his skills to reveal the surprises he is certain to find
        * Use assumptions as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them vigorously
        * A negotiation isn't a battle, it's an opportunity to discover information
        * Make your sole focus the other person and what they have to say
        * slow it down
        * put a smile on your face
    * Three voices of negotiators
        * Late night DJ: downward inflection calm and slow to make a point with authority without awakening defensiveness
        * Positive/playful voice: should be default, relax and smile while talking
        * Direct/assertive voice: use rarely
* Chapter 3 - 
    * Empathy: the ability to recognize and vocalize the other person's perspective. You don't have to agree with them, just imagine yourself in their shoes
    * Tactical empathy: understanding feelings and emotions-and what is behind them-so you can increase your influence
    * Labeling: validating someone's emotion by naming it
        * use "It sounds like..." rather than "I'm hearing that...": "I" gets people's guard up
        * After labeling, wait in silence
        * Labeling diffuses negative emotions and reinforces positive emotions
    * Accusation audit: list everything negative they could say about your to "take the sting out"
* Chapter 4 - No
    * Allow yourself and the other to say "no", it helps you feel comfortable and somewhat in control. No can mean:
        * I'm not ready
        * I'm uncomfortable
        * I need more information
        * ...etc.
    * No is a starting point
    * There are 3 kinds of yes: Counterfeit, confirmation, and commitment
    * Our primal urges: to feel safe/secure, and to feel in control
* Chapter 5
    * "That's right" is better than yes
    * "You're right" is dangerous
* Chapter 6
    * Compromise rarely leads to great results (think one brown shoe and one black shoe)
    * It is important to know each other's deadlines, but they aren't fixed in stone
    * "if you approach the negotiation thinking the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong"
    * The most powerful word in negotiation is "fair": 
        * "we just want what's fair"
        * "we have given you a fair offer"
        * "I want you to feel like you're being treated fairly at all times, so please stop me if you feel otherwise"
    * Anchor their emotions
        * anchor their emotions and expectations low and then play on loss aversion
    * let the other guy go first, usually
        * let them anchor and adjust, especially when you don't have all the information
    * establish a range
        * understand that if you offer a range they will come in low
    * pivot to non-monetary
    * when you talk numbers, use odd numbers
        * an odd number ($115,500) sounds more exact, calculated, and immovable than a round $110,000
    * make a surprise gift - which they will feel obligated to repay
    * SALARY NEGOTIATION
        * be pleasantly persistent on non-salary terms: builds the right environment for discussion and can lead to higher salary if they can't meet those desires
        * define success for your position and metrics for your next raise
        * "what does it take to be successful here": once they give you guidance they have a stake in if you succeed and you have gained a mentor
* Chapter 7
    * asking calibrated questions (asking for help) is the most powerful way to suspend unbelief, allows them to focus on solving the problem and gives them the illusion of control
    * instead of saying what you "need", describe what you are looking for and ask for suggestions
    * ask: "How am I supposed to do that?"
    * calibrated questions
        * be open ended, start with "what", "how"
    * calibrated questions require self-control 
        * bit your tongue
* Chapter 8
    * "yes" is nothing without "how"
    * signs that they're not on board with you:
        * "you're right" instead of "all right"
        * "I'll try" means "I plan to fail"
    * identify and motivate the players behind the table 
    * Dealing with difficult/aggressive negotiators:
        * 7-38-55: % contribution of message, tone, and body language, respectively
        * Rule of 3: get 3 yeses in the same conversation to confirm you are on the same page
        * Use your name in your speech as a form of "forced empathy"
        * use a multi step empathetic no
* Chapter 9
    * any response that is not an outright rejection means you have the edge
    * archetypes of negotiating style:
        * Accommodate
        * Assertive
        * Analyst
    * Ackerman bargaining system (for buying):
        * Set your target (goal)
        * Set you first offer at 65% target
        * Calculate 3 raises of decreasing increments (85%, 95%, 100%)
        * Use empathy and "no" to get the other side to counter before decreasing offer
        * Use precise, non-round number for your final offer
        * On final number, throw in a non-monetary item they don't care about to show you're at your limit
* Chapter 10
    * Black Swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on past experience (unknown-unknown)
    * never make a threat, but use labels to make the point:
        * "It seems like you value that I've always paid on time"
        * "It seems like you don't care what position you're leaving me in"
    * know your opponent's worldview or "religion"
    * People trust familiarity: build rapport
    * Express passion for their goals
    * Give a reason for your requests 
    * Don't accept that they are "crazy": search to understand why 
        * If they have bad information, they will make bad decisions 
        * Weird behavior might indicate constraints that they haven't revealed
        * They may have other interests 
    * Get face time
    * Observe the unguarded moments before and after the actual negotiation 
    * If it doesn't make sense, there are cents ($) to be made 
    * 3 types of leverage 
        * Positive (give them what they want)
        * Negative (hurt them)
        * Normative (using their norms to bring them around) 
* Prepare negotiation sheet
    * When the pressure is on, we fall to our highest level of preparation
    * The goal
        * Think though best/worst case scenarios but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case
        * Don't focus too much on BATNA since it can be too low and become your goal
        * Never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better
        * Write your goal down, discuss it with someone else, and carry the written goal into the negotiation 
    * Summary
        * Write out a couple sentences to understand facts that led to negotiation 
        * Your counterpart must be able to respond with "that's right"
    * Labels/Accusation Audit
        * Prepare 3-5 labels to perform and accusation audit
        * Make a list of accusations they might bring 
        * Then turn that list into labels and role play
        * Examples
            * It seems like x is valuable to you
            * It seems like you don't like x
            * It seems like you value x
            * It seems like x makes it easier
            * It seems like you're reluctant to x
    * Calibrated Questions
        * Prepare 3-5 calibrated questions 
        * Example "how" and "what" questions:
            * What are we trying to accomplish?
            * How is that worthwhile?
            * What's the core issue here?
            * How does that affect things?
            * What's the biggest challenge you face?
            * How does that fit in with the objective?
        * Behind the Table killers (committee) 
            * How does this affect the rest of the team?
            * How on board are the people not on this call?
            * What does your boss see as the main challenge?
        * Find deal-killing issues 
            * What are we up against here? 
            * What's the biggest challenge you face? 
            * What happens if you do nothing? 
    * Noncash Offers
        * Prepare a list of noncash items possessed by your counterpart that would be valuable 
        * What could they give us that would get us to do this for free? 


6/19/17 - Chaos by James Gleick
* Most important contributions of the 20th century:
    * Relativity
    * Quantum mechanics
    * Chaos - only one of these 3 that applies at the human scale 
* chaos reverses the trend of increasing specialization in the sciences 


6-18-17 - Beyond Band of Brothers by Dick Winters
* Maj. Winters talked about how the social life felt like an impediment to his promotions because he wouldn't go out drinking with the other officers. I feel the same way at work sometimes where I don't particularly care for sports and alcohol, but would rather read. But he says how he focused on being the best leader he could be, which clearly paid off in combat 


6/19/17 - Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut
* First Industrial Revolution devalued muscle work, then the second one devalued routine mental work. (pg. 14)
* That would be the third revolution, I guess—machines that devaluate human thinking. Some of the big computers like EPICAC do that all right, in specialized fields.” “Uh-huh,” said Katharine thoughtfully. She rattled a pencil between her teeth. “First the muscle work, then the routine work, then, maybe, the real brainwork.” “I hope I’m not around long enough to see that final step. (pg. 15)
* “I love you, Paul.” “I love you, Anita. Goodbye.” Anita had the mechanics of marriage down pat, even to the subtlest conventions. If her approach was disturbingly rational, systematic, she was thorough enough to turn out a creditable counterfeit of warmth. (pg. 17)
* In short, Paul missed what made his father aggressive and great: the capacity to really give a damn. (pg. 63)
* rnal vigilance was the price of efficiency. And the machines tirelessly riffled through their decks again and again and again in search of foot draggers, free riders, and misfits. (pg. 73)
* And Halyard suddenly realized that, just as religion and government had been split into disparate entities centuries before, now, thanks to the machines, politics and government lived side by side, but touched almost nowhere. (pg. 120)
* I do know that it’s far easier to ask questions than to answer them. (pg. 131)
* He wanted to deal, not with society, but only with Earth as God had given it to man. (pg. 137)

* “Afraid I don’t know how,” said Paul. “Maybe,” said Mr. Haycox walking away, “maybe if you’d of gone to college another ten or twenty years, somebody would of gotten around to showing you how, Doctor.” (pg. 157)

* “What have you got against machines?” said Buck. “They’re slaves.” “Well, what the heck,” said Buck. “I mean, they aren’t people. They don’t suffer. They don’t mind working.” “No. But they compete with people.” “That’s a pretty good thing, isn’t it—considering what a sloppy job most people do of anything?” “Anybody that competes with slaves becomes a slave,” (pg. 280)
* “Don’t you see, Doctor?” said Lasher. “The machines are to practically everybody what the white men were to the Indians. People are finding that, because of the way the machines are changing the world, more and more of their old values don’t apply any more. People have no choice but to become second-rate machines themselves, or wards of the machines.” (pg. 289)
* “I deny that there is any natural or divine law requiring that machines, efficiency, and organization should forever increase in scope, power, and complexity, in peace as in war. I see the growth of these now, rather, as the result of a dangerous lack of law. (pg. 301)
* “Without regard for the wishes of men, any machines or techniques or forms of organization that can economically replace men do replace men. Replacement is not necessarily bad, but to do it without regard for the wishes of men is lawlessness. (pg. 301)

5/30/17 - Happy City by Charles Montgomery
* 1. The Mayor of Happy City
    * 20th century’s dual urban legacy: 
        * First, the city had been gradually reoriented around private automobiles. 
        * Second, public spaces and resources had largely been privatized. Cars and mobile vendors took over public plazas and sidewalks. People had walled or fenced in what were once public parks.

* 2. The City Has Always Been a Happiness Project
    * Architecture offered a means to transcend worldly pain. Medieval churches made use of high walls and vaulted ceilings so that every visitor would have a personal experience of the Ascension. Even today, if you stand inside Paris’s Notre Dame Cathedral, your eye will inevitably be drawn higher and higher until it reaches an inner roof above the nave. As Richard Sennett once pointed out, it is a journey all the way to the base of heaven. The message is clear: happiness awaits in the afterlife, not here on earth. But the medieval church carried with it another message: that the anchor of the city, the place that gave it meaning and connected it to heaven, was public. Often churches were surrounded with open space delineating the shift from secular to sacred. Here, in the shadows of the church, is where babies were abandoned and plague victims tolerated. Here is where you could beg for help if you were desperate. At the heart of the city—the transition zone between earth and heaven—was a promise of empathy.Read more at location 343

    * What should a city accomplish after it meets our basic needs of food, shelter, and security? 
        * The city should strive to maximize joy and minimize hardship.

        * It should offer us real freedom to live, move, and build our lives as we wish. 
        * It should build resilience against economic or environmental shocks. 
        * It should be fair in the way it apportions space, services, mobility, joys, hardships, and costs. 
        * Most of all, it should enable us to build and strengthen the bonds between friends, families, and strangers that give life meaning, bonds that represent the city’s greatest achievement and opportunity.

    * The sociologist Robert Putnam warned back in 2000 that these networks of lighter relationships had been dwindling for decades. The trend has continued. People are increasingly solitary. In 1985 the typical American reported having three people he could confide in about important matters. By 2004 his network had shrunk to two, and it hasn’t bounced back since. Almost half the population say they have no one, or just one person, in whom they can confide. Read more at location 831

First we both must chart the geographic area each of us can reach in that time. Then we must see if our territories intersect. Then we need to figure out if the journey to and from a rendezvous point in that zone leaves enough time to make the meeting worthwhile. Each of us has an envelope of possibility on the space-time continuum. The more our envelopes intersect, the easier it is for us to actually see each other in person. Read more at location 877
* Chapter 4 - How We Got Here
    * The city we saw from the Repo Tour bus is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. It is not organic. It is not an accident. It was not fashioned by the desires of citizens operating in a free market. It was shaped by powerful financial incentives, massive public investment, and strict rules defining how land and roads can be developed and used. But these are merely tools, put to work in the service of ideas about urban happiness that were born during an age of acute urban trauma. Read more at location 975
    * The first philosophy might be called the school of separation. Its central belief is that the good life can be achieved only by strictly segregating the various functions of the city so that certain people can avoid the worst of its toxicity. The other we might call the school of speed. It translates the lofty concept of freedom into a matter of velocity—the idea being that the faster you can get away from the city, the freer you will become. Read more at location 994
    * “We have not had a free market in real estate for eighty years,” Ellen Dunham-Jones, Georgia Tech professor of architecture and coauthor of Retrofitting Suburbia, told me. “And because it is illegal to build in a different way, it takes an immense amount of time for anyone who wants to do it to get changes in zoning and variance. Time is money for developers, so it rarely happens.” Read more at location 1060
    * Cities, like many systems, are prone to a phenomenon known as autopoiesis, which can be compared to a viruslike process of entrenchment, replication, and expansion. The dispersed city lives not only in the durability of buildings, parking lots, and highways, but also in the habits of the professionals who make our cities. Once the system of dispersal was established in early suburbs, it began to repeat itself in plan after plan—not because it was the best response to any particular place, but because of the momentum of autopoiesis.

* Chapter 5 - Getting It Wrong
    * Humans do not perceive the value of things in absolute terms. We never have. Just as our eyes process the color and luminosity of an object relative to its surroundings, the brain constantly adjusts its idea of what we need in order to be happy. It compares what we have now to what we had yesterday and what we might possibly get next. It compares what we have to what everyone else has. Then it recalibrates the distance to a revised finish line. But that finish line moves even when other conditions stay the same, simply because we get used to things. So happiness, in these economists’ particular formulation, is inherently remote. It never stands still. Read more at location 1244
    * Stutzer and Frey found that a person with a one-hour commute has to earn 40 percent more money to be as satisfied with life as someone who walks to the office. On the other hand, for a single person, exchanging a long commute for a short walk to work has the same effect on happiness as finding a new love.* Read more at location 1282
    * However, it is much easier to adapt to things that stay constant than to things that change. So we adapt quickly to the joy of a larger house because the house is exactly the same size every time we come in the front door. But we find it difficult to adapt to commuting by car, because every day is a slightly new form of misery, with different people honking at us, different intersections jammed with accidents, different problems with weather, and so on.” Read more at location 1289

    * This is perhaps the most insidious way that the system of dispersal has punished those who live closer together. Most of the noise, air pollution, danger, and perceived crowding in modern cities occurs because we have configured urban spaces to facilitate high-speed travel in private automobiles.

It seems preposterous that we would choose a way of moving that simultaneously fails to maximize pleasure while maximizing harm. Read more at location 2811
    * When designers try to maximize the number of cul-de-sacs in an area, they create a dendritic—or treelike—system of roads that feeds all their traffic into a few main branches.

Most private cars spend the vast majority of their life span sitting, doing nothing but costing their owners money in insurance, lease payments, parking, and depreciation.

3/17/17 - The Benedict Option:A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation by Rod Dreher
* Introduction - The Awakening
    * from his previous book: Alasdair MacIntyre, who declared that Western civilization had lost its moorings. The time was coming, said MacIntyre, when men and women of virtue would understand that continued full participation in mainstream society was not possible for those who wanted to live a life of traditional virtue. These people would find new ways to live in community, he said, just as Saint Benedict, the sixth-century father of Western monasticism, responded to the collapse of Roman civilization by founding a monastic order. LOCATION: 61

        * Good people go to heaven when they die
    * THESIS OF THE BENEDICT OPTION: Could it be that the best way to fight the flood is to quit piling up sandbags and to build an ark in which to shelter until the water recedes and we can put our feet on dry land again? Rather than wasting energy and resources fighting unwinnable political battles, we should instead work on building communities, institutions, and networks of resistance that can outwit, outlast, and eventually overcome the occupation.

Instead of faith and reason, Macintyre says we are governed by emotivism: the idea that all moral choices are nothing more than expressions of what the choosing individual feels is right. LOCATION: 257 This society is a “collection of strangers, each pursuing his or her own interests under minimal constraints”:

    * The Benedict Option calls for a radical new way of doing politics, a hands-on localism based on pioneering work by Eastern bloc dissidents who defied Communism during the Cold War. A Westernized form of “antipolitical politics,” to use the term coined by Czech political prisoner Václav Havel, is the best way forward for Orthodox Christians seeking practical and effective engagement in public life without losing our integrity, and indeed our humanity. LOCATION: 1167
    * If conservative church leaders aren’t extraordinarily careful in how they manage their public relationship to the Trump administration, anti-Trump blowback will do severe damage to the church’s reputation. Trump’s election solves some problems for the church, but given the man’s character, it creates others. Political power is not a moral disinfectant. LOCATION: 1206
        * There is also the danger of Christians falling back into complacency. No administration in Washington, no matter how ostensibly pro-Christian, is capable of stopping cultural trends toward desacralization and fragmentation that have been building for centuries. To expect any different is to make a false idol of politics. LOCATION: 1212
        * Will the law as written by a conservative legislature and interpreted by conservative judges overwrite the law of the human heart? No, it will not. Politics is no substitute for personal holiness. LOCATION: 1223

    * Religious liberty is critically important to the Benedict Option. LOCATION: 1249
    * Given the post-Christian turn in American culture, that is no longer enough. Kinzer has plunged more deeply into the life of his congregation, teaching a class on Augustine’s City of God and organizing a new prayer meeting for men and women.

* Chapter 5 - A Church for All Seasons
    * Wilkes: At this moment in the Church’s history in this country (and in the West more generally) it is less urgent to convince the alternative culture in which we live of the truth of Christ than it is for the Church to tell itself its own story and to nurture its own life, the culture of the city of God, LOCATION: 1497

* Chapter 7 - Education as Christian Formation
    * Today, across the Christian community, there is a growing movement called classical Christian education. It is countercultural in both form and content and presents to students the Western tradition—both Greco-Roman and Christian—in all its depth. Doing it right requires a level of effort and commitment that contemporary Americans are not accustomed to—but what alternative do we have? LOCATION: 2161
    * Give Your Family a Rightly Ordered Education
        * Every educational model presupposes an anthropology: an idea of what a human being is. In general, the mainstream model is geared toward equipping students to succeed in the workforce, to provide a pleasant, secure life for themselves and their future families, and ideally, to fulfill their personal goals—whatever those goals might be. The standard Christian educational model today takes this model and adds religion classes and prayer services. But from a traditional Christian perspective, the model is based on a flawed anthropology. In traditional Christianity, the ultimate goal of the soul is to love and serve God with all one’s heart, soul, and mind, to achieve unity with Him in eternity. To prepare for eternal life, we must join ourselves to Christ and strive to live in harmony with the divine will. LOCATION: 2179
        * To compartmentalize education, separating it from the life of the church, is to create a false distinction. LOCATION: 2189
        * Educator Martin Cothran, a national leader in the classical Christian school movement, says that many Christians today don’t realize how the nature of education has changed over the past hundred years. The progressivism of the 1920s involved using schools to change the culture. The vocationalism of the 1940s and 1950s tried to use schools to conform children to the culture. But the traditional way of education, which reigned from the Greco-Roman period until the modern era, was about passing on a culture and one culture in particular: the culture of the West, and for most of that time, the Christian West.

If future generations fail to learn to love our Western cultural heritage, we will lose it. LOCATION: 2264 
        * I can relate to this: I am a college-educated American. In all my years of formal schooling, I never read Plato or Aristotle, Homer or Virgil. I knew nothing of Greek and Roman history and barely grasped the meaning of the Middle Ages. Dante was a stranger to me, and so was Shakespeare. The fifteen hundred years of Christianity from the end of the New Testament to the Reformation were a blank page, and I knew only the barest facts about Luther’s revolution. I was ignorant of Descartes and Newton. My understanding of Western history began with the Enlightenment. Everything that came before it was lost behind a misty curtain of forgetting. Nobody did this on purpose. Nobody tried to deprive me of my civilizational patrimony. But nobody felt any obligation to present it to me and my generation in an orderly, coherent fashion. Ideas have consequences—and so does their lack. The best way to create a generation of aimless know-nothings who feel no sense of obligation beyond themselves is to deprive them of a past.

* Chapter 8 - Preparing for Hard Labor
    * First of all, the Benedictine model reminds us that work and worship are integrated and that our careers are not separate from our faith. Second, it reminds us that manual labor is a gift—a gift that Christians may have to rediscover if post-Christianity squeezes us out of the professions.

    * Sex and the Incarnation
        * Chastity—the rightly ordered use of the gift of sexuality—was the greatest distinction setting Christians of the early church apart from the pagan world.4 
        * The point is not that Christianity was only, or primarily, about redefining and revaluing sexuality, but that within a Christian anthropology sex takes on a new and different meaning, one that mandated a radical change of behavior and cultural norms. In Christianity, what a person does with their sexuality cannot be separated from what a person is. LOCATION: 2938
        * Anything we do that falls short of perfect harmony with the will of God is sin. Sin is not merely rule breaking but failing to live in accord with the structure of reality itself. LOCATION: 2954 
        * “The significance of sexual difference has never before been contingent upon a creature’s preferences, or upon whether or not God gave it episodically to a particular creature to have certain preferences,” writes Catholic theologian Christopher Roberts. He goes on to say that for Christians, the meaning of sexuality has always depended on its relationship to the created order and to eschatology—the ultimate end of man. LOCATION: 2960 
    * Sexual Revolution
        * “The death of a culture begins when its normative institutions fail to communicate ideals in ways that remain inwardly compelling,” Rieff writes. By that standard, Christianity in America is in mortal danger. LOCATION: 3015

        * Watering down or burying biblical truth on sexuality for the sake of keeping Millennials won’t work. LOCATION: 3018

        * Andrew T. Walker, a Southern Baptist lay leader of the Millennial generation, says he grew up in a good church but never heard a single sermon about Christian anthropology (i.e., what is man?) or biblical sexuality beyond conservative platitudes. LOCATION: 3029
    * Moralism is Not Enough
        * As Pope Benedict XVI has written, “God’s way of loving becomes the measure of human love. This close connection between eros and marriage in the Bible has practically no equivalent in extra-biblical literature.” LOCATION: 3082
        * Unbridled erotic passion creates chaos and disintegration. Eros that submits to Christ bears fruit in the gift of children, stable families, and communities. The contemporary Orthodox theologian Olivier Clément says that the spiritual secret of Christianity is that the love of God comes through the human body and flows throughout the universe to which it is joined. In Christianity, the individual’s desire (eros) is purified and transformed into agape—unconditional, selfless love. LOCATION: 3090

    * Fight Pornography with Everything
        * As with so many other things in contemporary society, we modern Americans see sex as wholly a private matter, one of individual rights. But this is false. The rules, rituals, and traditions of a community pertaining to sexuality, says Berry, intend “to preserve its energy, its beauty, and its pleasure; to preserve and clarify its power to join not just husband and wife to one another but parents to children, families to the community, the community to nature; to ensure, so far as possible, that the inheritors of sexuality, as they come of age, will be worthy of it.” LOCATION: 3204
* Chapter 10 - Man and the Machine
    * Technology is Not Morally Neutral
        * In a powerful address to a 2015 Catholic gathering in Philadelphia, philosopher of science Michael Hanby explained that “before technology becomes an instrument, it is fundamentally a way of regarding the world that contains within itself an understanding of being, nature, and truth.” LOCATION: 3248
        * More deeply, though, technology as a worldview trains us to privilege what is new and innovative over what is old and familiar and to valorize the future uncritically. It destroys tradition because it refuses any limits on its creativity. Technological Man says, “If we can do it, we must be free to do it.” To the technological mind, questions of why we should, or should not, accept particular technological developments are hard to comprehend. LOCATION: 3263
    * The Internet is the Floodgate of Liquid Modernity
        * The result of this is a gradual inability to pay attention, to focus, and to think deeply. Study after study has confirmed the common experience many have reported in the Internet age: that using the Web makes it infinitely easier to find information but much harder to devote the kind of sustained focus it takes to know things. LOCATION: 3322

    * Take on Digital Fasting as an Ascetic Practice
        * In Dante’s Divine Comedy, the pilgrim protagonist (also named Dante) learns that sin is disordered love. The source of all disorder is loving finite things more than the infinite God.

Those are dangers that our Christian brothers and sisters in China, Nigeria, and the Middle East face. For us, the greatest danger comes from the liberal secular order itself. And our failure to understand this reinforces our cultural captivity and the seemingly unstoppable assimilation of the next generations. LOCATION: 3487

3/16/17 - Out of the Ashes: Rebuilding American Culture by Anthony Esolen
* Introduction
    * “We are incompetent in the ordinary things of life.” (10)
        * ***This really is the biggest take-away for me from this book. I want to strive for excellence in the ordinary things of fatherhood, work, relationships, faith, citizenship.
    * “Every single pagan philosopher of the ancient world said that if you wanted to be free, you had to learn the hard ways of virtue and that the worst form of slavery was slavery to your own appetites.” (10)
* Truth
    * Clear your mind of smalltalk about big words (diversity, inclusivity, etc) and actually talk about your life:
        * “Here is a quick and generally reliable rule to follow. If people have always said it, it is probably true; it is the distilled wisdom of the ages. If people have not always basis it, but everybody is saying it now, it is probably a lie; it is the concentrated madness of the moment.” (22)
        * …”For truly tolerant people are hard to offend.” (23)
    * Immerse yourself in nature
        * On the role of nature in seeking truth: “the truth we are seeking must not be merely abstract…Therefore we have to immerse ourselves in things: trees, stars, mud grouse…” (24)
    * Learn to speak and read
        * “If our language is inane and empty, our thoughts will be inane and empty too” (27)
        * Learn our language in all its riches by reading old books (28)
        * “Poetry is the noblest of human arts”: Psalms, Job, Isaiah, Paradise Lost … “let the poets teach us how to read and speak and think” (30)
* Beauty
    * “If you went to Chartres, you would not need to suppose, you would simply and readily receive that the most important thing was to sing with the Psalmist, ‘I rejoiced when I heard them say, Let us go up to the house of the Lord.’” (35)

* School
    * lots of talk about one room schoolhouses
    * “All human sciences are grammatical in structure” (61)
    * the reversal of power in the parent-teacher relationship: the parent “ought to be considered the teacher’s employer, or the one who delegates his authority to the teacher under certain conditions that he and his fellow parents stipulate” (63)
    * “Politics can come later. Aristotle said that young men-much older than our children in school-were not yet ready to study politics, because they had not yet amassed any great experience of human nature. That is what literature is for, and history also; a story of stories.” (67)
    * “There is little left in English literature if the religious is barred at the door…The great questions of human existence are and always will be religious…We may say also that in the whole history of man there is no education of a human soul unless the divine animates it” (70)
* College
    * a list of strong liberal arts Catholic colleges bottom of 80-81
* Manhood
    * “The seminal error of feminism…is the assumption that you cannot actually seek the good of woman without taking account of the good of man, as if the sexes were independent of one another, or forever antagonistic. Man and woman are for one another.” (93)
    * “The ways of men and women take different forms in different places and at different times, but they are always and immediately recognizable as the ways of men and the ways of women” (94-95)
    * Liberty can be judged by (104-105):
        * how far from your house you are comfortable letting your children play alone
        * the range of things you don’t vote on because people take care of them for themselves

    * Chapters 8-12 speak to our reasons for hope and how we can live as Christians with joy 
* Chapter 2 - History 
    * Kraynak's themes of the Founders' vision:
        * Republicanism: balance of power; division of power; class representation; ensure sovereignty but moderate majority rule 
        * Constitutionalism: single document created new; can change but difficult to lint passions
        * Natural law: moral order 
        * Cultural tradition: greater narrative, humility about our place in the world 
    * America is a Protestant nation from the beginning without a previous catholic culture. Chesterton: "America has always been a nation that thinks it's a church." (34)

    * Closes with American idealism and stating that America can only endure with its structure as long as there are leaders who embody the philosophy of the founders
* Chapter 3
    * It is important to catalog the ways our culture is changing to understand if we need to fix it or if it's healthy
    * "The surest way to transform a culture is from the inside out. And the sheer path to doing it isn't through reasoned debate or violence but by colonizing and reshaping the culture's appetites and behaviors" (46)

* Chapter 4 - Beauty in Nature

    * As traditional authority and structure disintegrates (family, church), it is replaced with government, which is less human (100-101)
* Chapter 6 - Truth
    * Democracy leads to over importance of public opinion where we are more comfortable with lies or half truths to fit in than seeking truth but risking social harm
    * So we have two powerful forces that drive our lives: public opinion (wanting to not stick out) and the market economy 
    * We grow in truth by seeking it continually (if not, it fades from view) (113)
    * We can't just blame "the culture" because we are the culture (117)
    * "Caring for language is a moral issue" - Marilyn chandler McEntyre (120)
* Chapter 7 - 
    * Thought experiment from After Virtue...we use the same words for morality but they have lost their meaning (126-127)
    * "The enlightenment tried to keep the more content of Christianity while eliminating its religious base. But it doesn't work. The biblical grounding can't be cut away without undermining the whole moral system. Every attempt to build a substitute system has suffered from incoherence, no matter how reasonable sounding." (130)
    * After Virtue in American culture:
        * Social siences: 
            * More atheistic than other disciplines and has social agenda

1/23/17 - Universe of Stone: A Biography of Chartres Cathedral by Philip Ball
* “Chartres contains the first known statue of Mary” (62)
* “Gothic churches display, in a way that Romanesque does not, an overarching vision: a sense of wholeness and coherence.” (63)
* “I turned my face towards Paris and the thrill of this happy pilgrimage compelled me to confess: ‘Truly the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.’ It came to my mind how the poet said: ‘A happy thing is exile in such a place as this.’” - Peter Abelard (93)


1/3/17 - The City of God by Augustine
* References
    * Strangers in a Strange Land by Chaput, 12-16
* Book I
    * 9 talks about how good and bad are punished together because good loves the world and is afraid to admonish bad. This reminded me of the priest in Arizona who preached against voting for Democrats who support abortion. How are we called in family life to love in this culture without giving into its vices and make sure we admonish sin when we confront it?


1/1/17 - So Good They Can’t Ignore You by Cal Newport
* (full notes in physical copy)
* "To summarize, if your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to acquire career capital. Your next step is to invest this capital in the traits that define great work. Control is one of the most important targets you can choose for this investment.” 
* "I have argued that “follow your passion” is bad advice, as most people aren’t born with pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered. If your goal is to love what you do, you must first build up “career capital” by mastering rare and valuable skills, and then cash in this capital for the traits that define great work. As I’ll explain, mission is one of these desirable traits, and like any such desirable trait, it too requires that you first build career capital—a mission launched without this expertise is likely doomed to sputter and die."
