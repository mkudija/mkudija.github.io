## Books Mentioned
- *Irresistable* by Adam Alter
- *Lead Yourself First: Inspiring Leadership Through Solitude* by Raymond M. Kethledge, Michael S. Erwin


## Introduction
- we need a "full-fledged philosophy of technology use" (xiv)


# Part I - Foundations

## Chapter 1 - A Lopsided Arms Race
- recall that the iPhone was originally just designed to be a phone and a music player...the internet connetivity took over later
- digital experiences are addictive, especially with respect to *intermittent positive reinforcement* and *the drive for social approval* (17)

## Chapter 2 - Digital Minimalism
- **Digital Minimalism** - A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.
- minimalist philosophy: work backwards from your deeply held values when deciding how to live your life (31)
- constantly perform cost-benefit analyses
- **Principles of Digital Minimalism**:
  - 1. *Clutter is costly*: Thoreau's key insight is that there is a cost in "life" (time) that we need to weight against any benefit
  - 2. *Optimization is important*: remember diminishing returns, but most of us are on the left hand side of the curve and have huge gains to realize through some optimization
  - 3. *Intentionality is satisfying*: for the Amish, intention trumps convenience: intentionally vet technology based on its impact on their core community values

## Chapter 3 - The Digital Declutter
- The Digital Declutter
  - For 30 days, put aside optional technologies
  - During this period, rediscover activities and behaviors that you find meaningful (and make decisions about technology use while away from its aura)
  - Reintroduce optional technologies starting from a blank slate. For each determine what value it offers and how to maximize this value. Each technology you include must:
    1. Serve something you deeply value
    2. Be the *best* way to use technology to serve this value (if not, replace it with something better)
    3. Have an SOP defining *when* and *how* you use it


# Part II - Practices

## Chapter 4 - Spend Time Alone (in Solitude)
- interesting discussion of Lincoln's solitude (away from the White House at the Soldier's Home) which "helped save the nation"
- *Lead Yourself First: Inspiring Leadership Through Solitude* by Raymond M. Kethledge, Michael S. Erwin
  - their definition of **solitude**: "a subjective state in which your mind is free from the input from other minds"
  - Newport counters with **solitude deprivation**: a state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from the input of other minds (103)
- "the iPod provided for teh first time the ability to be continuously distracted from your own mind...it's now possible [with smartphones] to completely banish solitude from your life" (100-101)
- solitude deprivation leads to mental health problems, particularly axiety, as shown by iGen kids who are always connected and never have time alone with their thoughts
- Solitude practices:
  - Leave your phone at home: strive for significant periods without your phone most days
  - Take long walks: Thoreau's [*Walking*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1862/06/walking/304674/), Newport: "I would be lost without my walks because they have become one of my best sources of solitude." (120)
  - Write letters to yourself: keep a notebook for your thoughts
