- Mediocristan vs Extremistan
-

### Books From Taleb 
- *The Berlin Diaries* by William Shirer (history as it is taking place, 12-13)
- *Aversos Mathematicos* by Sextus
- *Il deserto dei tartari* by Dino Buzzati (92)
- *Essays* by Montaigne (101)
- *Lost Illusions* by Lucien Chardon (104)

### Anecdotes & Life Lessons
- "You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just to show that you can walk the walk." (7)
- Don't read newspapers or watch TV (17)
- "The Good Life" for him is "f*** you money" enabling this: "So I stayed in the quant and trading businesses (I'm still here), but organized myself to do minimal but intense (and entertaining) work, focus only on the most technical aspects, never attend business 'meetings', avoid the company of 'achievers' and people in suits who don't read books, and take a sabbatical year for every three on average to fill up gaps in my scientific and philosophical culture." (21)
- **Erudition**: "Erudition is important to me. It signals genuine intellectual curiosity. It accompanies an open mind and the desire to probe the ideas of others. Above all, an erudite can be dissatisfied with his own knowledge, and such dissatisfaction is a wonderful shield against Platonicity, the simplifications of the five-minute manager, or the philistinism of the overspecialized scholar." (48)
- "heoroes focus on process rather than results" (89)
- Business psychology insight (98)

### Funny
- The business world is "inelegant, dull, pompous, greedy, unintellectual, selfish, and boring" (17)
- "Scientists may be in the business of laughing at their predecessors, but owing to an array of human mental dispositions, few realize that someone will laugh at their beliefs in the (disappointingly near) future." (39)

### Prologue
- Black Swans are (xxii):
  - rare
  - have extreme impact
  - are predictable only in retrospect
- Free markets work because they allow people to be *lucky*—tinker as much as possible and try to collect Black Swan opportunities (xxv)
- **Platonicity**: what makes us think that we understand more than we actually do (xxx)
- **Platonic Fold**: where our representation of reality ceases to apply, where Black Swans happen (19)


## Part One: Umberto Eco's Antilibrary, or How We Seek Validation
- "Read books are far less valuable than unread ones." (and other great quotes on 1)

### Chapter 1: The Apprenticeship of an Empirical Skeptic
- **Triplet of Opacity** (issues with our minds coming up against history, 8):
  - *illusion of understanding*
  - *retrospective distortion*
  - *the overvaluation of factual information, i.e. "Platonification"*
- history unfolds in bursts (like Thomas Kuhn says about scientific revolutions, 11), and isn't predictable
- "Both the philosophy of history and epistemology (the philosophy of knowledge" seemed inseparable from the empirical study of times series data" (20)

### Chapter 2: Yevgenia's Black Swan
- fictional story about a book that unexpectedly took off

### Chapter 3: The Speculator and the Prostitute
- "To be genuenely empirical is to reflect reality as faithfully as possible" (27)
- Scalable profession advice led him to **the problem of induction**: aka the turkey problem; technical name for the Black Swan
  - a scalable profession is good only if you are successful: few win and a lot lose
- **Mediocristan**: when your sample is large, no single instance will significantly change the total (physical measurements like body size, etc.)
  - Type 1 randomness
- **Extremistan**: inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the total (social measurements wealth, book sales, etc.)
  - Type 2 randomness
  - this is where Black Swans occur

### Chapter 4: One Thousand and One Days, or How Not to Be a Sucker
- The turkey illustrates the danger of predicting the future from past data: it was fine for 1000 days until it got its head chopped off (41)
- The turkey problem = the problem of induction = Hume's problem = the problem of generalizing from available information

### Chapter 5: Confirmation Shmonfirmation!
- we naturally look to confirm our story—*confirmation bias*—"but disconfirming instances are far more powerful in establishing truth" (58)
- Karl Popper: "understanding how to act under conditions of incomplete information is the highest and most urgent human pursuit"
  - form a bold conjecture, and look for what would prove you wrong

### Chapter 6: The Narrative Fallacy
- *Narrative fallacy*: our need to fit a story to a series of events
  - Avoid the narrative fallacy by favoring experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories (84)
- a) as humans we need to summarize information, and b) more random is more difficult to summarize: *"the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is"* (69)
  - "Myths impart order to the disorder of human perception and the perceived 'chaos of human experience'"
- Kahneman & Tversky: most of our mistakes in reasoning (and missing Black Swans) come from using System 1 when we think we are using System 2 (81-82)
  - *System 1*: heuristics and biases
  - *System 2*: thinking

### Chapter 7: Living in the Antechamber of Hope (Linearity)
- Linear relationships are the exception but we are not wired to think non-linearly
- Happiness: lump negative and spread positive (91)

### Chapter 8: Giacomo Casanova's Unfailing Luck: The Problem of Silent Evidence
- *that we got here by accident does not mean that we should continue to take the same risks* (116)
- Taleb argues that this negates the cosmological argument (117-118)
- Don't compute odds from the winners but from all those in the cohort (119)
  - Also don't read self-help books written by winners that neglect all the failures
- *"be suspicious of the 'because' and handle it with care—particularly in situations where you suspect silent evidence"* (121)
