# Reading Notes

I have been recording notes on what I read since about 2010, with varying fidelity and level of detail. 

- Many books that I read as hard copies have notes and underlines in the book itself. These are trascribed with varying levels of completeness, if at all.
- Books I read in college are likely either not represented or under-represented, since these notes are contained in my Notre Dame Summary.
- Books I read as eBooks often have quotations directly copied electronically and may not have page numbers that correspond with the printed book.
- Books I listened to as Audiobooks likely are missing detailed citation information.
