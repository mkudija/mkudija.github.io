## Preface

## Introduction
- The Goal: produce an *interpretable* model that translates raw data into information relevant to decision-making; project information into a low-dimensional space that contains key insights for decision making (3-4)
  - Motivating example: visualized CAPM outputs give a richer view for decisions making than just a messy plot of returns (Figure I.3, [reproduced here](https://github.com/mkudija/taddy-business-data-science/blob/main/0-introduction/3-stock-returns/0-introduction_stock-returns.ipynb))
- "Modern methods" are distinguished by *big data* and *machine learning*
  - Data Science ≈ statistics + BD + ML
  - Business Data Science ≈ statistics + BD + ML + economics + econometrics + business context
- **Big Data**: data can be "big" in terms of both *volume* and *complexity*
  - Big (*volume*) Data is where the scale swamps RAM and requires piping by data engineers
  - Big (*complexity*) Data is big *dimension* data where the assumptions of classical statistics break down ("big *p*" problems)
- **Machine Learning**: automatically build *predictions* from complex data
  - Focus is to maximize predictive performance on out-of-sample data
  - Limited *structural* interpretability: black box for making predictions when the future follows the same patterns as the past (with the implicit warning about the danger of changing patterns)
  - *Structural analysis* refers to building analytically from theory, as compared with the pragmatic, black-box *prediction* of machine learning
  - Good data science then is having an overall understanding of the domain to know the appropriate *prediction* tasks to throw at ML, and the *structural* problems to address with classical economics and statistics
  - "A policy-maker who can deploy ML to solve the many prediction tasks that they face will be able to automate and accelerate their decision process." (7)
  - ML prediction tools should be part of a larger system with goals beyond pure prediction
- **Computation**
  - This book uses R, but the key point is that "anyone working with data will need to continue learning and updating their computational (and methodological) skills"; best way to learn is by doing (11)
