# *The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of Distraction* by Alan Jacobs
2018-04-04

## Yes, we can!
- *How to Read a Book* is all about the *how* of reading, motivated by an insecure drive for self-improvement. Jacobs witnesses lots of readers who lack confidence in their reading (5-6) 
- "Reading is one of the great human delights." (10), and this is the *first* reason we should read in the first place
- He wants to offer a model of reading different from the "Responsibility, Obligation, and Virtue" of *How to Read a Book* (11)


## Whim
**READ AND RE-READ THIS SECTION**

- Lots of people ask him for reading recommendations, but he never responds because (13):
  - You can get the "Greatest Hits" of Western Literature anywhere, so don't need him to tell it to you
  - People have different tastes, so a book that was meaningful to him might not be to you
  - He has a [page on his website](http://ayjay.org/recommending.html) that nicely summarizes this
- Quotes Rudyard Kipling's essay "The Uses of Reading": "One can't prescribe books, even the best books, to people unless one knows a good deal about each individual person. If a man is keen on reading, I think he ought to open his mind to some older man who knows him and his life, and to take his advice in the matter, and above all, to discuss with him the first books that interest him." (14)

***Read for Whim***: let the pleasure of reading be its end (14-16):
- "...I don't like mixing reading with onerous duties." (14)
- He uses the memoirs of Richard Rodriguez *Hunger for Memory* as an example of the mental state of reading as obligation he wants to avoid:
  - On reading Plato: "I needed to keep looking at the book jacket comments to remind myself what the text was about. Nevertheless,...I looked at every word of the text. And by the time I reached the last word, I convinced myself that I had read *The Republic*. In a ceremony of great pride, I solemnly crossed Plato off my list."
- Rather, Jacobs is committed to *read at whim* which he learned from Randall Jarrell:
  - "To him [reading] wasn't a means to a lecture or article, it was an end; he read not for anything he could get out of it, but for itself. And isn't this what the work of art demands of us?" (15)

- Don't let your reading become page-counting and box-checking (merely "social and ethical hygiene" as he quotes Lewis)..."how depressing" (17)
- And don't be guided by Harold Bloom and others who preach an authoritative canon because it can only make people feel two ways (18-21):
  - Arrogant that "I and a few others like me, read the *proper* works"
  - "How can I be worthy of this high calling?"

- Jacobs discusses pretension and signaling (21-22), which he says is "forgivable and even touching" in youth, but "can be unpleasant in a mature adult" (22)

- His final recommendation? "Read what gives you delight—at least most of the time—and do so without shame. And even if you are that rare sort of person who is delighted chiefly by what some people call Great Books, don't make them your steady intellectual diet, any more that you would eat at the most elegant of restaurants every day. It would be too much. Great books are great in part because of what they ask of their readers: they are not readily encountered, easily assessed." (23)

- He closes (24-25) with a discussion of Walter Kirn and Cathleen Schine, and how they were able to discover their love for *real* reading well after reading as a forced activity
  - Kirn was playing an empty game of "learning as a form of borrowing" and "intelligence as a form of borrowing slyly".


## All in your head
- first he discusses the work of brain scientists (Wolf and Dehaene) discussing the physiology and neurology of reading, which he finds interesting but not the type of reading he is interested in
- instead, take some inspiration from Dickens' David Copperfield: *reading as if for life* (31-33)
- Jacobs marvels in the mystery of why we would *read for whim* as he previously recommends (33)
