He presents the keys to financial IQ as accounting (financial literacy), investing (making money), markets (sieze opportunity),  and the law (know and play by the rules). He also stresses the importance of learning to manage cash flows, systems, and people. The biggest message of the book is to buy assets, which are things (property, stocks, businesses, etc.) that will make you money rather than cost you money.\"}, {\"Title\": \"Artemis\", \"Author\": \"Andy Weir\", \"Type\": \"Library\", \"Read\": 2017, \"Published\": 2017, \"Pages\": 320.0, \"Notes\": null, \"Reflection\": \"I don't think Andy Weir can beat *The Martian* but I had to read his next book.

It was quite a broad ranging topic with plenty of anecdotes about servants, mousetraps, toilets, epidemeology, and industrialization. Living at home was a slow process of moving toward comfort, which there was suprising little of even fairly recently. Much of his discussion focuses on the 19th century when many modern comforts started to come into place.

It took me awhile to get to and then awhile to get through, and I think I benefitted from revisiting it bit by bit over a couple of months. A new notes follow. He talks about how instilling a love of learning in your kids is more important than any single skill they might learn in skill (73). He listed his four top daily priorities (pray, read, write, and exercise), which I took as inspiration when writing my 2018 goals to slim down my Way of Life app and focus some quantitative goals on these and similarly important activities (74). He talked about how once you have written a book it can never be taken away from you, and that is a goal of mine (112). He also talked about building your little shelf of important books, and idea I love and which reminds me of the chapter on reading in Ben Sasse's book (76). He spoke about how he visited elderly people in a nursing home when he was in high school and how that was such a positive experience both for him and them, again reminding me of Sasse and thinking of that as a goals for our kids (86). Finally, he had a beautiful section on confession. I especially loved his description of how frequent confession is needed to keep us sensitized to sin (141). I've read Matthew Kelly for a long time.

It has certainly impacted my attitude toward my work at Milestone in a positive way, and I started journaling sometime after reading this which has had a huge impact on my life.

This is a rigorous, detailed exploration of religious faith as it relates to science, particularly physics. I found myself at times not interested in the level of detail he gave, but it is so important to have this available and for us to engage in reflection about what how what we discover in science relates to philosophy and theology.

I also really liked the line \\\"A people without history is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern of timeless moments\\\" which comes a few lines earlier. Apart from \\\"Little Gidding\\\" my favorite of the Four Quartets is East Coker, which talks about losing tradition: \\\"Do not let me hear of the wisdom of old men, but rather their folly, their fear of fear nad frenzy, their fear of possession, of belonging to another, or to others, or to God.\\\" Wow! This sounds like it could have been written this year.

Unfortunately, I think what I liked about him in that interview (his wide-ranging interesting tidbits) was the downfall of this particular book. It seemed to have nothing to do with the title and without a central thesis. His thoughts about autism, or \\\"autistic cognitive patterns\\\", was interesting though probably taken a bit too far. His thoughts on politics and technology did not age well into the 2016 election and the Trump era.

He recommended it in a newsletter about email when discussing her \\\"Cycle of Responsiveness\\\" (6) where the pressure to always \\\"be on\\\" leads to a vicious cycle of always being on. The rest of the book is a discussion of how she implemented PTO (**PTO = predictability + teaming + open communication) at BCG, and then instructions to implement it in your own organization. These are effective strategies to manage work life balance especially in absurd jobs, and certainly some of them can be applied in less-extreme jobs. However, I think a first step is to *avoid* a culture of work like this in the first place, and to *set expectations from day 1* that you don't check your email at home, work on the weekends, etc.\"}, {\"Title\": \"The Formula: How Algorithms Solve All Our Problems . . . and Create More\", \"Author\": \"Luke Dormehl\", \"Type\": \"Audiobook\", \"Read\": 2018, \"Published\": 2015, \"Pages\": 288.0, \"Notes\": \"Yes\", \"Reflection\": \"I had been waiting to listen to this for awhile since it looked interesting, but it didn't live up to expectations.

Some tidbits I enjoyed inlcude the discussion of his personal library in the preface and Christians popularizing the Codex in Chapter 9, which I read about previously from Turner and Jacobs. He also mentions how the 1969 lectionary was a significant ecumentical milestone, and how Jesus' mind was so saturated with the scriptures.

Putting aside the politicized and simplistic description of transgenderism (\\\"I'm have a girl brain in a boy body\\\") I tried to be open-minded in learning about Jazz's story, how Jazz's parents have responded to the situation, how Jazz deals with ongoing depression, and how Jazz has become a transgender activist.

Deneen says that liberalism is founded on a false anthropology, which must be recovered if we are to flourish. Humans are made for relationship and to live in harmonty with nature.

It gives a lighter-weight version of some of their work than Thinking Fast and Slow, and is also a fascenating story about how their partnership led to amazing results. I like their definition of a nerd: \\\"a person who knows his own mind well enough to mistrust it.\\\" It was interesting to learn that they worked with Delta Airlines to pioneer Crew Resource Management, saving many lives. I also liked the thought when talking about basketball analytics models toward the beginning of the book that \\\"having a model without human input forces you to ask the right kind of questions.\\\"\"}, {\"Title\": \"Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross-Sections\", \"Author\": \"Stephen Biesty & Richard Platt\", \"Type\": \"Library\", \"Read\": 2018, \"Published\": 1992, \"Pages\": 47.0, \"Notes\": \"No\", \"Reflection\": \"This was a favorite of mine as a kid and I got it from the library many times.

These books are wonderful and you get lost in them in a good way. While reading this I started reading and listening to The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by Shirer, and was amazed to see that this volume is dedicated to him, and references him frequently. It is appalling how the leadership of Britain and France gave Hitler everything he wanted and more to avoid war, and it becomes apparent how WWII is really just the continuation of unsolved problems (esp. Versailles) from WWI. Churchill's firmness during a decade of ridicule and his consistency in speaking the truth about Hitler is nothing short of a lesson in holding firm to values. It was tragedy that brought him to power, and a vindication in spite of that tragedy.

This was especially while finishing the second volume of *The Last Lion*. A sad fact is that there were so many opportunities to stop Hitler's rise. And yet the people of Germany were either unaware of easily distracted, and the Western democracies (led by Chamberlain) were so horrified by WWI that they went to absurd lengths to give Hitler whatever he wanted in the hope he wouldn't bring war. Likewise, once the Third Reich was at the peak of its power, there were many times it could have crushed Western civilization, but Hitler hesitated or made the wrong military decisions and thus the downfall was brought about. Shirer lets the facts speak for themselves, but he clearly disdains Hitler and the evil he brought about. More importantly for us though is his illustration of how people who could have easily stopped him allowed him to come to power, particularly the German people, the Appeasers in the West (Chamberlain), and his subordinates who never carried out a coup.\"}, {\"Title\": \"The House At Pooh Corner\", \"Author\": \"A.

He agrues that because of difficulties transitioning to a) and b) the natural end state is the servile state. The servile state consists of compulsory labor legally enforcible upon those who do not own the means of production for the advantage of those who do.
