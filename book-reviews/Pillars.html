					At its heart, <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> is a story about the construction of a cathedral. It is an epic of rivalry, romance, defeat, challenge, and ultimately grand success. Beyond this, though, it is a coming of age story of a community and several of the key people who

					Most important to me about <i>Pillars</i> though is not the story itself, but the interest it awakened in me. Since reading this, I have become all the more fascenated with architecture and the Middle Ages. This has started me on a new adventure of reading and discovery.

					In the preface to <i>Pillars</i>, Ken Follett describes some of his detailed background research that prepared him to write the novel, which included reading the likes of Jean Gimpel, the French historian and medievalist, and Nikolaus Pevsner, the German-born British historian of architecture. Starting with these, I went on to read Gimpel's <i>The Medieval Machine: The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages</i> and Pevsner's classic <i>An Outline of European Architecture</i>, both of which are excellent for putting the Medieval period and architecture, respectively, in more context. <i>The Medieval Machine</i> reviews the impressive range of technologies developed in the period that enabled actual cathedral building as well as providing for the general prosperity that made them economically feasible. Pevsner gives a broad history of architecture in Europe, moving from classical to Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Romantic, and Modern: this serves to situate Gothic architecture in the larger progression of styles. The Gothic style is distinctive for its pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rib vaults, though Pevsner notes that "The features which make up the Gothic style are well enough known, too well in fact, because most people forget that a style is not an aggregate of features, but an integral whole" (89).

					Visiting Paris
