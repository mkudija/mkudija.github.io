					<i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> is a story about the construction of a cathedral in fictional 12th century Kingsbridge, England. It is an epic of rivalry, romance, defeat, challenge, and ultimately success. Beyond this, though, it is the coming of age story of a community as it seeks its place in a changing and challenging world, and the people who help create a great cathedral: Tom the builder, Philip the prior, and Jack the stone carver. The story is enthralling and has reawakened my fascenation with architecture and the Middle Ages.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In the preface to <i>Pillars</i>, Ken Follett describes some of his detailed research that prepared him to write the novel, which included reading the likes of Jean Gimpel, the French historian and medievalist, and Nikolaus Pevsner, the German-born British historian of architecture. Starting with these, I went on to read Gimpel's <i>The Medieval Machine: The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages</i> and Pevsner's classic <i>An Outline of European Architecture</i>, both of which are excellent for putting the Medieval period and architecture, respectively, in broader context. <i>The Medieval Machine</i> reviews the impressive range of technologies developed in the period that enabled cathedral building as well as providing for the general prosperity that made them economically feasible. Pevsner gives a broad history of architecture in Europe, moving from classical to Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Romantic, and Modern: this serves to situate the Gothic cathedrals in the larger sweep of architectural development. 
				</p>

				<p>
					My interest in a number of works read since <i>Pillars</i> has its roots in the story of the Kingsbridge cathedral. <i>Cathedral: The Story of Its Construction</i> by David Macaulay is a children's book with excellent illustrations that help build an understanding of Gothic cathedral design and construction. <i>How to Read Churches: A Crash Course in Ecclesiastical Architecture</i> by Dennis R. McNamara is a short overview of the history and elements of church buildings, also with excellent illustrations. The twin themes of Medieval monastic life and architectural development led me to Umberto Eco's <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, a mystery set in a 12th century Italian abbey, and Campbell's <i>The Library: A World History</i>, tour of libraries through the ages accompanied by stunning photography. Finally, <i>Universe of Stone: A Biography of Chartres Cathedral</i> by Philip Ball gives a colorful introduction to Gothic architecture by focusing on one of its gems: Notre Dame de Chartres. Still on my list to continue learning about Gothic architecture are <i>The Cathedral Builders</i> by Jean Gimpel, <i>The Gothic Cathedral</i> by Christopher Wilson, and <i>Understanding Architecture</i> by Leland M. Roth and Amanda C. Roth Clark.

					The Gothic style is made distinctive by three main elements: pointed arches, flying buttresses, and rib vaults. However, Pevsner notes that "The features which make up the Gothic style are well enough known, too well in fact, because most people forget that a style is not an aggregate of features, but an integral whole" (89). The "integral whole" Pevsner speaks of is what makes Gothic architecture--and the culture that produced it--so impressive. Christian society in the High Middle Ages comes to life and remains with us today in the great Gothic cathedrals. Light breaks through immense stained glass windows, literally shining through the saints to illuminate the darkness within. Starting with the main piers, large as trees, moving upward into the brightness of the clerestory, and extending to the highest point in the vaulted ceiling, the eye is drawn upward to the heavens. As Philip Ball explains, “Gothic churches display, in a way that Romanesque does not, an overarching vision: a sense of wholeness and coherence” (63). Walking through a Gothic church is a sacramental experience.

					Visiting Paris

					* “I turned my face towards Paris and the thrill of this happy pilgrimage compelled me to confess: ‘Truly the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.’ It came to my mind how the poet said: ‘A happy thing is exile in such a place as this.’” - Peter Abelard (93)
