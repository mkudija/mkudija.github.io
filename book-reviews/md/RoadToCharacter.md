*The Road to Character* is David Brooks' humble reflection on what it means to live a good life. Through examining the lives of a diverse set of admirable individuals, he move towrad a definition and outline of character in his "Humilty Code."

Brooks opens by reflecting on the two sides of our nature, using the terms Adam I to refer to our pursuit of the résumé virtues, and Adam II to refer to our pursuit of the eulogy virtues.[^Soloveitchik] "While Adam I wants to conquer the world, Adam II ants to obey a calling to serve the world" (xii). Brooks frames his reflection on charaacter in the context of this Adam II against the life of "vague moral aspiration" he has lived and with the goal of better articulating what charater is and how we might strive for it.

[^Soloveitchik]: Brooks cites [*The Lonely Man of Faith*](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Man-Faith-Joseph-Soloveitchik/dp/0385514085/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506712551&sr=8-1&keywords=the+lonely+man+of+faith) by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik as the source of the terms Adam I and Adam II. For Adam II, relationsion—particularly a redemptive relationship with God—is important.

## Notes
### The Humility Code (261-267)
1. We are not made for happiness, we are made for **holiness**.
2. We are sinners.
3. But, we are also wonderfully made.[^psalm139]
4. The greatest virtue in the struggle against our own weakness is **humility**: awareness of ourselves and our place in the universe.
5. Conversely, the central vice is **pride**, which misleads us into thinking we are better than we are and the authors of our own lives. 
6. The central struggle in life is that against sin and for virtue. Our purpose is not to "win", but to improve.
7. **Character** is a set of dispositions, desires, and habits that are slowly engraved during the struggle against your own weakness. Central to character is **self-discipline**.
8. Character is a long-term project. People with character are anchored by permanent attachements to important things.
9. The the struggle of character we need redemptive assistance from outside—from God, family, friends, ancestors, rulers, traditions, institutions, and exemplars.
10. We are saved by **grace**.[^ccc1996]
11. Defeating weakness requires quieting the self: reticence, modesty, obedience, and reverance.
12. Develop wisdom through epistemological modesty, starting with the tradition of our past.
13. We live the good life by answering the call from without, by living out our **vocation**.
14. A good leader is the steward of her organization and leads along the grain of human nature.
15. Our aim should not be riches or fame, but **maturity**: a settled unity of purpose.
