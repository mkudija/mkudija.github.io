*The Road to Character* is David Brooks' humble reflection on what it means to live a good life. Through examining the lives of a diverse set of admirable individuals, he move towrad a definition and outline of character in his "Humilty Code."

Brooks opens by reflecting on the two sides of our nature, using the terms Adam I to refer to our pursuit of the résumé virtues, and Adam II to refer to our pursuit of the eulogy virtues.[^Soloveitchik] "While Adam I wants to conquer the world, Adam II ants to obey a calling to serve the world" (xii). Brooks frames his reflection on charaacter in the context of this Adam II against the life of "vague moral aspiration" he has lived and with the goal of better articulating what charater is and how we might strive for it.

[^Soloveitchik]: Brooks cites [*The Lonely Man of Faith*](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Man-Faith-Joseph-Soloveitchik/dp/0385514085/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506712551&sr=8-1&keywords=the+lonely+man+of+faith) by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik as the source of the terms Adam I and Adam II. For Adam II, relationsion—particularly a redemptive relationship with God—is important.

* book from Fr. Missmi
* What is character? 
* lives...
* "I've also become more aware that, like many people these days, *I have lived a life of vague moral aspiration*—vaguely wanting to be good, vaguely wanting to serve some larger purpose, while lacking a concrete moral vocabulary, a clear understanding of how to live a rich inner life, or even a clear knowledge of how character is developed and depth is achieved" (xiv)...some key concepts in this vocaulary are:
	* humility: "the awareness that there's a lot you don't know and that a lot of what you think you know is distorted or wrong" (8-9); intellectual humility: "accurate self-awareness from a distance" (9)
	* wisdom: "The mosral quality of knowing what you don't knowand figuring out a way to handle your ignorance, uncertainty, and limitation" (9)

	* soul
	* vocation (24)
	* sin (53)
	* also reminded me of how Thoreau: "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation" (*Walden*, 8, Norton, New York, 2008)

> People with vocations are generally not morose...If you serve the work—if you perform each task to its utmost perfection—then you will experience the deep satisfaction of craftsmanship and you will end up serving the community more richly than you could have consciously planned. And one sees this in people with a vocation—a certain rapt expression, a hungry desire to perform a dance or run an organization to its utmost perfection. They feel the joy of having their values in deep harmony with their behavior. They experience a wonderful certainty of action that banishes weariness from even the hardest days. (25)

# Notes

## Introduction
- "This book is about Adam II. It's about how to cultivate strong character. It's about one mindset that people through the centuries have adopted to put iron in their core and to cultivate a wise heart. I wrote it, to be honest, to save my own soul" (xiii).
- "I've also become more aware that, like many people these days, I have lived a life of vague moral aspiration—vaguely wanting to be good, vaguely wanting to serve some larger purpose, while lacking a concrete moral vocabulary, a clear understanding of how to live a rich inner life, or even a clear knowledge of how character is developed and depth is achieved" (xiv).
- The people picked in the following chapters were aware of their weaknesses and fought against them (the "crooked timber" approach to life). We can learn from their example. 

## 1. The Shift
- we have shifted from a culture of humility, *The Little Me*, to a culture where people see themselves as the center of the universe, *The Big Me* (6)

### Humility
* humility: "the awareness that there's a lot you don't know and that a lot of what you think you know is distorted or wrong" (8-9); intellectual humility: "accurate self-awareness from a distance" (9)
* wisdom: "The mosral quality of knowing what you don't knowand figuring out a way to handle your ignorance, uncertainty, and limitation" (9)
* "crooked timber" view of humanity he references if from Kant: "Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made" (11)

## 2. The Summoned Self *(Frances Perkins)*
* **Vocation**: "People with vocations are generally not morose...If you serve the work—if you perform each task to its utmost perfection—then you will experience the deep satisfaction of craftsmanship and you will end up serving the community more richly than you could have consciously planned. And one sees this in people with a vocation—a certain rapt expression, a hungry desire to perform a dance or run an organization to its utmost perfection. They feel the joy of having their values in deep harmony with their behavior. They experience a wonderful certainty of action that banishes weariness from even the hardest days" (25)
* **Silence**: "I have discovered that rule of silence is one of the most beautiful things in the world. It preserves one from the temptation of the idle world, the fresh remark, the wisecrack, the angry challenge...It is really quite remarkable what it does for one" (44)

## 3. Self-Conquest *(Dwight Eisenhower)*
* Ike's turning point was his mother reminding him of this from the Bible: "He that conquereth his own soul is greater than he who taketh a city" (52, cf. Proverbs 16:32)
* **Sin**: "we have obscured the inescapable moral core of life with shallow language" (54)
	* "The danger of sin is that it feeds on itself" (55)

* **Character**: "Since self-control is a muscle that tires easily, it is much better to avoid temptation in the first place rather than try to resist it once it arises" (56)
	* **Character** is an ensamble of settled dispositions—of habitual feelings and desires" (57, cf. Anthony T. Kronman)

* **Self-Control**: "Freedom has been defined as the opportunity for self-discipline" (61, Eisenhower)

* "Always try to associate yourself closely and learn as much as you can from those who know more than you, who do better than you, who see more clearly than you" (63, cf. *At Ease* by Eisenhower)
* Leadership principle: "My own conviction is that every leader should have enough humility to accept, publicly, the rsponsibility for the mistakes of the subordinates he has himself selected and, likewise, to give them credit, publicly, for their triumphs" (64)
* On not letting on to all that you know: "He was reasonably learned in ancient history, admiring especially the crafty Athenian leader Themistocles, but he never let that on. He did not want to appear smarter than other people, or somehow superieor to the average American. Instead, he cultivated the image of simple, unlearned charm" (68)

### The Humility Code (261-267)
1. We are not made for happiness, we are made for **holiness**.
2. We are sinners.
3. But, we are also wonderfully made.[^psalm139]
4. The greatest virtue in the struggle against our own weakness is **humility**: awareness of ourselves and our place in the universe.
5. Conversely, the central vice is **pride**, which misleads us into thinking we are better than we are and the authors of our own lives. 
6. The central struggle in life is that against sin and for virtue. Our purpose is not to "win", but to improve.
7. **Character** is a set of dispositions, desires, and habits that are slowly engraved during the struggle against your own weakness. Central to character is **self-discipline**.
8. Character is a long-term project. People with character are anchored by permanent attachements to important things.
9. The the struggle of character we need redemptive assistance from outside—from God, family, friends, ancestors, rulers, traditions, institutions, and exemplars.
10. We are saved by **grace**.[^ccc1996]
11. Defeating weakness requires quieting the self: reticence, modesty, obedience, and reverance.
12. Develop wisdom through epistemological modesty, starting with the tradition of our past.
13. We live the good life by answering the call from without, by living out our **vocation**.
14. A good leader is the steward of her organization and leads along the grain of human nature.
15. Our aim should not be riches or fame, but **maturity**: a settled unity of purpose.
