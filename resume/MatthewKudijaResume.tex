%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%\section{Qualifications}
%\vspace{6pt}

%Skilled scientist and researcher with expertise in problem-solving, mathematics, software development, data and statistical analysis, and data visualization. I have many years of experience in scientific computing using Python, R, C/C++, Fortran, Matlab, Linux, and Mathematica. I also have extensive research experience in data analysis theory and application, time-series analysis, technical writing and public speaking. I am a continual learner and have completed several MOOCs in Deep Learning and Machine Learning. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	GOALS SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%\section{Goals}
%\vspace{6pt}
%
%To work on technical and intellectually challenging projects that would benefit from my expertise in data analysis, problem-solving, and mathematics. I am particularly interested in extracting valuable insights from large and/or noisy data sets and discovering new  and effective ways to visualize these data. I am interested in learning more about big data tools and machine learning. Currently finishing up a 3-year academic fellowship but will be available for full-time, part-time, or contract work beginning in the summer of 2017.

%\section{Recent Scientific Highlights}
%\vspace{6pt}

%\begin{itemize}

%\item Leading the development of a \textcolor{cyan}{\href{https://github.com/nanograv/enterprise}{new data analysis suite}} written in Python. This code base leverages many tools and techniques from software development including unit tests, continuous integration, auto-generated documentation, and a modular object oriented design.
%\vspace{6pt}

%\item Devised a new method to model non-gaussian transient features in pulsar timing data using reversible jump Markov Chain Monte-Carlo and model averaging techniques. This work is reported in my 2016 \textcolor{cyan}{\href{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvD..93h4048E}{\emph{Physical Review D} paper.}} \vspace{6pt}

%\item Developed and implemented complex and robust noise models for pulsar timing data. Worked with the pulsar timing working group within NANOGrav to implement these models in to the standard pulsar timing software and analysis packages. These new techniques allow for more robust and unbiased estimation of pulsar timing parameters and lead to new pulsar mass measurements, tests of General Relativity, and tests of fundamental physics.
%\vspace{6pt}

%\item Led the NANOGrav detection group in and \textcolor{cyan}{\href{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...821...13A}{extensive study}} of upper limits on gravitational waves due to supermassive black hole binaries. This study was the first of its kind it that it attempted to place constraints on physical parameters related to galaxy evolution and dynamics instead of just on the gravitational waves emitted. This work was part of a NASA and NRAO press release and was reported in several popular science outlets.
%\vspace{6pt}

%\item Have authored or co-authored \textcolor{cyan}{\href{https://jellis18.github.io/publication/}{17 peer-reviewed scientific publications}}.\vspace{6pt}

%\item Have run several \textcolor{cyan}{\href{https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school}{workshops and schools}} training undergraduate and graduate students in data analysis, particularly for time series analysis using Bayesian methods.
%\vspace{6pt}

%\item Have given many scientific presentations at astronomy and physics conferences and invited lectures at various universities.
