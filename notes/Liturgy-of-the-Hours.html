<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<ul>
<li>Apostolic Constitution 
<ul>
<li>"The Liturgy of the Hours was seen as a kind of necessary complement to the fullness of divine worship that is contained in the eucharistic sacrifice, by means of which that worship might overflow to reach all the hours of daily life." (11)</li>
<li>"The result was that <a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Sacrosanctum concilium.md">the Council</a> treated the liturgy as a whole, and the Hours in particular, with such thoroughness and skill, such spirituality and power, that there is scarcely a parallel to it in the entire history of the Church." (13)</li>
<li>"It is supremely to be hoped that the Liturgy of the Hours may pervade and penetrate the whole of Christian prayer, giving it life, direction and expression and effectively nourishing the spiritual life of the people of God." (16)</li>
<li>"To manifest this quality of our prayer more clearly, 'the warm and living love for holy Scripture' which is the atmosphere of the Liturgy of the Hours must come to life in all of us, so that Scripture may indeed become the chief source of all Christian payer." (17, cf. <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Sacrosanctum concilium.md">SC</a></em> 24)</li>
<li>"<a href="Mental-Prayer.html">Mental Prayer</a> should draw unlimited nourishment from readings, psalms, and the other parts of the Liturgy of the Hours." (18)</li>
<li>"The Hours are recommended to all Christ's faithful members, including those who are not bound by law to their recitation." (18)</li>

<li>Vol. I, pg. 405 (<a href="../reading-notes/2024-12-25-Wed.html">2024-12-25-Wed</a> Office of Readings for Christmas, from a Sermon by <a href="St.-Leo-the-Great.html">St. Leo the Great</a>): "Christian, remember your dignity, and now that you share in God's own nature, do not return by sin to your former base condition. Bear in mind who is your head and of whose body you are a member. Do not forget that you have been rescued from the power of darkness and brought into the light of God's kingdom. Through the sacrament of baptism you have become a temple of the Holy Spirit. Do not drive away so great a guest by evil conduct and become again a slave to the devil, for your liberty was bought by the blood of Christ." </li>
<li>Vol. I, pg. 831 (<a href="../reading-notes/2022-12-05-Mon.html">2022-12-05-Mon</a> Evening Prayer of Monday of the Second Week of Advent): "When you took on flesh, Lord Jesus, you made a marriage of mankind with God." </li>

  <p>Help us to receive good things from your bounty with a deep sense of gratitude, and to accept with patience the evil that comes to us.<br />
  Teach us to be loving not only in great and exceptional moments, but above all in the ordinary events of daily life.<br />
  May we abstain from what we do not really need, and help our brothers and sisters in distress.<br />
  May we bear the wounds of your Son, for through his body he gave us life.</p>

<li>Vol. II, pg. 1335 (<a href="../reading-notes/2025-01-28-Tue.html">2025-01-28-Tue</a>): from a conference by <a href="St.-Thomas-Aquinas.html">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>: "If you seek <a href="patience.html">patience</a>, you will find no better example than the cross.

<ul>
<li>Vol. III, pg. 1573 (<a href="../reading-notes/2022-08-16-Tue.html">2022-08-16-Tue</a>): from the catechetical instructions by <a href="St.-John-Vianney.html">St. John Vianney</a>: "The Christian's treasure is not on earth but in heaven. Our thoughts, then, ought to be directed to where our treasure is.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-treasure"><a href="#fn-treasure">1</a></sup> This is the glorious duty of man: to pray and to love. If you pray and love, that is where a man's happiness lies. <a href="Prayer.html">Prayer</a> is nothing else but union with God...We had become unworthy to pray, but God in his goodness allowed us to speak with him. Our prayers are incense that gives him the greatest pleasure. My little children, your hearts are small, but prayer stretches them and makes them capable of loving God. Through prayer we receive a foretaste of heaven and something of paradise comes down upon us. Prayer never leaves us without sweetness. It is honey that flows into the soul and makes all things sweet.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-honey"><a href="#fn-honey">2</a></sup> When we pray properly, sorrows disappear like snow before the sun."</li>

His gift is very great indeed, but our capacity is too small and limited to receive it. That is why we are told: <em>Enlarge your desires, do not bear the yoke with unbelievers.</em>" ^a7495d</li>
