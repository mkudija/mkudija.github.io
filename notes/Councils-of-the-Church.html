<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><em>431</em>  </p>

<h3 id="a-hrefchalcedonhtmlchalcedona"><a href="Chalcedon.html">Chalcedon</a></h3>

<p><em>451</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Condemned Monophysitism (also called Eutychianism), which denied Christ’s human nature.</p>

<p><em>680</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Condemned Monothelitism, which held Christ had but one will, the divine (this heresy arose as a reaction to the monophysite heresy); censured Pope Honorius I for a letter in which he made an ambiguous but not infallible statement about the unity of operations in Christ (an episode commonly used by anti-Catholic writers as an argument against papal infallibility, but for the real meaning, see <em>Catholicism and Fundamentalism</em>, pages 227-229).</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefnicaea-iihtmlnicaea-iia"><a href="Nicaea-II.html">Nicaea II</a></h3>

Emperor Basil, 867-886</p>

<h3 id="a-hreflateran-iihtmllateran-iia"><a href="Lateran-II.html">Lateran II</a></h3>

<p><em>1139</em><br />
Pope Innocent II, 1130-1143<br />
Emperor Conrad III, 1138-1152</p>

<p>Decisions: Regulated papal elections by requiring a two-thirds vote of the cardinals (see in this issue the article by Canon Francis J. Ripley, page 27); condemned Waldensianism and Albigensianism, a form of Manichaeanism (an ancient heresy that held that matter is evil; Albigensians opposed the authority of the state and of the Church, opposed the sacrament of matrimony, and practiced ritual suicide; despite these tenets, many anti-Catholics believe Albigensianism was the continuation of “real Christianity” during the Middle Ages and was a forerunner of Protestantism).</p>

<h3 id="a-hreflateran-ivhtmllateran-iva"><a href="Lateran-IV.html">Lateran IV</a></h3>

<p><em>1215</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Ordered annual reception of penance and the Eucharist; used the term “<a href="Transubstantiation.html">Transubstantiation</a>” to explain the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist; adopted further canons against the Albigensians.</p>

<h3 id="constance">Constance</h3>

<p><em>1414</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Ended the Great Schism, which involved three rival claimants to the papacy (see in this issue the article by Canon Francis J. Ripley, page 27); opposed the teachings of John Wycliffe, who taught <em>sola scriptura</em>, denied the authority of the pope and bishops, denied the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and wrote against penance and indulgences; condemned as a heretic John Huss, who denied papal authority and taught wrongly about the nature of the Church and who was burned at the stake in 1415 (in 1457 his followers established what became known commonly as the Moravian Church, which was the first independent Protestant church).</p>

<h3 id="florence">Florence</h3>

<p><em>1438-1443</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Reaffirmed papal primacy against claims of conciliarists that an ecumenical council is superior to a pope; approved reunion with several Eastern Churches, but the reunion was only temporary.</p>

<h3 id="lateran-v">Lateran V</h3>

<p><em>1512-1517</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Opposed erroneous teachings about the soul; reaffirmed the doctrine of indulgences; restated the relationship between popes and ecumenical councils; on the eve of the Protestant Reformation, failed to inaugurate an authentic and thoroughgoing reform of the Church, inadvertently helping Protestantism.</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefvatican-ihtmlvatican-ia"><a href="Vatican-I.html">Vatican I</a></h3>

<p><em>1869-1870</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Defined papal infallibility and primacy; condemned errors regarding the relationship between faith and reason (the council was cut short by war, its work to be taken up again by Vatican II).</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefvatican-iihtmlvatican-iia"><a href="Vatican-II.html">Vatican II</a></h3>
