<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<p><em>431</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Condemned Nestorianism, which denied the unity of the divine and human in Christ; defined that Mary is the Mother of God (<em>Theotokos</em>), a doctrine denied by the Nestorians and by most of today’s Protestants; condemned Pelagianism, which held that man could earn his own salvation through his natural powers.</p>

<p><em>680</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Condemned Monothelitism, which held Christ had but one will, the divine (this heresy arose as a reaction to the monophysite heresy); censured Pope Honorius I for a letter in which he made an ambiguous but not infallible statement about the unity of operations in Christ (an episode commonly used by anti-Catholic writers as an argument against papal infallibility, but for the real meaning, see <em>Catholicism and Fundamentalism</em>, pages 227-229).</p>

<h3 id="text-stylebackground-color-whitesmoke-color-23537dnicaea-iitext"><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Nicaea II</text></h3>

<p>Decisions: Regulated papal elections by requiring a two-thirds vote of the cardinals (see in this issue the article by Canon Francis J. Ripley, page 27); condemned Waldensianism and Albigensianism, a form of Manichaeanism (an ancient heresy that held that matter is evil; Albigensians opposed the authority of the state and of the Church, opposed the sacrament of matrimony, and practiced ritual suicide; despite these tenets, many anti-Catholics believe Albigensianism was the continuation of “real Christianity” during the Middle Ages and was a forerunner of Protestantism).</p>

<h3 id="text-stylebackground-color-whitesmoke-color-23537dlateran-ivtext"><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Lateran IV</text></h3>

<h3 id="vienne">Vienne</h3>

<p><em>1311</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Suppressed the Knights Templars; issued decrees on the reform of morals.</p>

<h3 id="constance">Constance</h3>

<p><em>1414</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Ended the Great Schism, which involved three rival claimants to the papacy (see in this issue the article by Canon Francis J. Ripley, page 27); opposed the teachings of John Wycliffe, who taught <em>sola scriptura</em>, denied the authority of the pope and bishops, denied the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and wrote against penance and indulgences; condemned as a heretic John Huss, who denied papal authority and taught wrongly about the nature of the Church and who was burned at the stake in 1415 (in 1457 his followers established what became known commonly as the Moravian Church, which was the first independent Protestant church).</p>

<h3 id="florence">Florence</h3>

<p><em>1438-1443</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Reaffirmed papal primacy against claims of conciliarists that an ecumenical council is superior to a pope; approved reunion with several Eastern Churches, but the reunion was only temporary.</p>

<h3 id="text-stylebackground-color-whitesmoke-color-23537dvatican-itext"><text style="background-color: whitesmoke; color: #23537d;">Vatican I</text></h3>

<p><em>1869-1870</em>  </p>

<p>Decisions: Defined papal infallibility and primacy; condemned errors regarding the relationship between faith and reason (the council was cut short by war, its work to be taken up again by Vatican II).</p>
