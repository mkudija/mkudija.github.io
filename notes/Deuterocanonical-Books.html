<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h1 id="deuterocanonical-books">Deuterocanonical Books</h1>

<p><em>This note is a draft, written from a Roman Catholic perspective—if you have additions or changes to suggest, please feel free to <a href="mailto:m.kudija@proton.me">let me know</a>.</em></p>

<p>The Deuterocanonical ("second canon") books of the <a href="Old-Testament.html">Old Testament</a> are considered canonical by Catholic and certain Orthodox Churches. Most Protestant ecclesial communities regard the deuterocanonical books as apocryphal, or not part of the canon of scripture.</p>

<p>In the first century there was not an "official" Jewish canon of scripture. Many of the first Christians, including the inspired authors of the New Testament, frequently quoted the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures (Old Testament) commonly known at the time and referred to today as the <a href="Septuagint.html">Septuagint</a>. The difference arises because the deuterocanonical books are present in the Greek <a href="Septuagint.html">Septuagint</a> but not in various Hebrew manuscripts. </p>

<p><a href="St.-Jerome.html">St. Jerome</a>'s fourth century Latin translation of the Bible, the <a href="Vulgate.html">Vulgate</a>, was made from the <a href="Septuagint.html">Septuagint</a> and therefore included the deuterocanonical books. (Interestingly, he apparently did not regard all of the Greek text canonical but was obedient to the Pope and included them.)  The "official" canon of scripture grew out of this Tradition and was affirmed at various <a href="Councils-of-the-Church.html">councils</a>, including the <a href="Council-of-Trent.html">Council of Trent</a>.</p>

<p>Protestant rejection of the deuterocanonical books originates in <a href="Martin-Luther.html">Luther</a>'s labeling of these books as the Apocrphya and placing them between the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>The books of the Apocrypha and the Deuterocanonical Books of the Catholic Old Testament are related as follows<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-ascension"><a href="#fn-ascension">1</a></sup>:</p>

<li>"Today most Protestant Bibles have sixty-six books.

<li>"While the New Testament never directly quotes from or names these books, the apostles most frequently used and quoted the <a href="Septuagint.html">Septuagint</a>, which includes them.

<ul>
<li>Always be faithful to God, even when you seem to be in an impossible position. God rescues now (as he did Susanna in <a href="Dn-13.html">Dn-13</a>), and preserves for eternity (as he did the seven brothers and their mother in <a href="2-Mc-07.html">2 Mc-07</a>).</li>
<li>Judith reminds us to be grateful when God puts us to the test: "We should be grateful to the Lord our God, for putting us to the test, as he did our forefathers...Not for vengeance did the Lord put them in the crucible to try their hearts, nor has he done so with us. It is by way of admonition that he chastises those who are close to him." (<a href="Jdt-08.html">Jdt-08</a>-27)</li>
