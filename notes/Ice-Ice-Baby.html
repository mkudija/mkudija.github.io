<h1 id="lyrics-by-vanilla-ice">lyrics <em>by Vanilla Ice</em></h1>

<p>Yo, VIP, let's kick it!  </p>

<p>Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby  </p>

<p>All right stop, Collaborate and listen<br />
Ice is back with my brand new invention<br />
Something grabs a hold of me tightly<br />
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly<br />
Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know<br />
Turn off the lights and I'll glow<br />
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal<br />
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.  </p>

<p>Dance, go rush the speaker that booms<br />
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom<br />
Deadly, when I play a dope melody<br />
Anything less than the best is a felony<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-excellent"><a href="#fn-excellent">1</a></sup><br />
Love it or leave it, you better gangway<br />
You better hit bull's eye, the kid don't play  </p>

<p>If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it<br />
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it  </p>

<p>Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  </p>

<p>Now that the party is jumping<br />
With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumpin'<br />
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking<br />
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon<br />
Burning them they ain't quick and nimble<br />
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal<br />
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo<br />
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo<br />
Rollin' in my 5.0<br />
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow<br />
The girlies on standby, waving just to say, "Hi!"<br />
Did you stop? No, I just drove by<br />
Kept on pursuing to the next stop<br />
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block<br />
That block was dead Yo<br />
So I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.  </p>

<p>Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis<br />
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis<br />
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine<br />
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine<br />
Ready for the chumps on the wall<br />
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of "Eight Ball"<br />
Gunshots ranged out like a bell<br />
I grabbed my nine, all I heard was shells<br />
Falling on the concrete real fast<br />
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas<br />
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed<br />
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack<br />
Police on the scene, you know what I mean<br />
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends  </p>

<p>If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it<br />
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it  </p>

<p>Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  </p>

<p>Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet<br />
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it<br />
My town, that created all the bass sound<br />
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground<br />
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill<br />
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel<br />
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept<br />
We make it hype and you want to step with this<br />
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja<br />
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJs say, "Damn."<br />
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram<br />
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose<br />
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice  </p>

<p>If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it!<br />
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it.  </p>

<p>Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla<br />
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  </p>

<p>Yo, man, let's get out of here! Word to your mother!  </p>

<p>Ice Ice Baby Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold<br />
Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold</p>

<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->
