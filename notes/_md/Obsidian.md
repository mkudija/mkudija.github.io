	-  ‚è´ for high priority

## Obsidian Publish
[Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) is a paid service to publish part of your vault online. I use my own pair of scripts for [notes](https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/blob/master/notes/_build/_build.py) and [reading notes](https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/blob/master/reading-notes/_build/_build.py) to publish from my vault with limited functionality, and I am tracking [[Obsidian Publish Alternatives]] with an eye toward adding more functionality in the future.

## Callouts
