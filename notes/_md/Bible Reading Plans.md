# Bible Reading Plan: Make Your Own

This tool will prepare a custom Bible reading plan for you based on the chapters of the Bible you would like to read, the start date you choose, and the number of "laps" (i.e. perhaps you would like to read the New Testament 4 times over the year). 

Here is the file: [Bible Reading Plans - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbXELS-YDPzssrHz04_Idf9W4Ii-4XQwcupXGSPEhUI/edit#gid=1594583958)

1. Make a copy of this sheet for your personal use: **File** > **Make a copy**
2. Select the chapters of the Bible you would like to read by adding a column on the `Chapters` tab.
3. Prepare your reading plan on the `Reading Plan` tab by entering the "start date", "laps", and "plan name" you will read.
4. Navigate to the `Print` tab to print a formatted copy of your reading plan.
