# Marriage of Many Years
*by [[Dana Gioia]]*

Most of what happens happens beyond words.  
The lexicon of lip and fingertip  
defies translation into common speech.  
I recognize the musk of your dark hair.  
It always thrills me, though I can't describe it.  
My finger on your thigh does not touch skin—  
it touches _your_ skin warming to my touch.  
You are a language I have learned by heart.  
   
This intimate patois will vanish with us,  
its only native speakers. Does it matter?  
Our tribal chants, our dances round the fire  
performed the sorcery we most required.  
They bound us in a spell time could not break.  
Let the young vaunt their ecstasy. We keep  
our tribe of two in sovereign secrecy.  
What must be lost was never lost on us.
