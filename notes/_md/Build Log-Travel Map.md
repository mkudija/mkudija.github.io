# Build Log: Travel Map

## Summary
- **Cost**: ~$0 (scrap wood)
- **Time**: ~1 week
- **Completed**: [[2022-08-22-Mon]]


## Notes 
- Wood used is all scrap: walnut I slabbed last year that was uneven to too small for other projects, a few pieces of ambrosia maple, salvaged construction lumber, and small scraps too small for other projects. 
- I made a jig that clamps to the table saw crosscut sled to cut the hexagons.
	- First, get a piece of wood that is approximately square
	- Make the first 30ยบ cut on the miter saw
	- Cut the remaining edges using the jig on the table saw
- Sand on the belt sander to get a flat surface (these were pretty rough)
- Sand to 120 grit
- 1 light coat of Danish oil on the front and edges 
- The frame these are mounted on consists of 1.25" wide stringers on the diagonal, and two 1x~3 horizontal braces. The stringers are screwed to the braces. The top brace is cut at 45ยบ on the bottom to accept a french cleat for mounting.
- The hexagons are glued onto the stringers. 
- We will Mod-Podge on a family photo to each state as we visit it!
