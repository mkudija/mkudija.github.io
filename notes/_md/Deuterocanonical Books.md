# Deuterocanonical Books

The Deuterocanonical ("second canon") books of the [[Old Testament]] are considered canonical by Catholic and certain Orthodox Churches. Most Protestant ecclesial communities regard the deuterocanonical books as apocryphal, or not part of the canon of scripture.

In the first century there was not an "official" Jewish canon of scripture. Many of the first Christians, including the inspired authors of the New Testament, frequently quoted the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures (Old Testament) commonly known at the time and referred to today as the [[Septuagint]]. The difference arises because the deuterocanonical books are present in the Greek [[Septuagint]] but not in various Hebrew manuscripts. 

[[St. Jerome]]'s fourth century Latin translation of the Bible, the [[Vulgate]], was made from the [[Septuagint]] and therefore included the deuterocanonical books. (Interestingly, he apparently did not regard all of the Greek text canonical but was obedient to the Pope and included them.)  The "official" canon of scripture grew out of this Tradition and was affirmed at various [[Councils of the Church|councils]], including the [[Council of Trent]].

Protestant rejection of the deuterocanonical books originates in [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s labeling of these books as the Apocrphya and placing them between the Old and New Testaments.

The books of the Apocrypha and the Deuterocanonical Books of the Catholic Old Testament are related as follows[^ascension]:

- "Today most Protestant Bibles have sixty-six books.

- "While the New Testament never directly quotes from or names these books, the apostles most frequently used and quoted the [[Septuagint]], which includes them. Some say there is a correspondence of thought, and others see texts from these books being paraphrased, referred or alluded to many times in the New Testament, particularly in the Pauline epistles...The [[Septuagint]] translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which the early Christian church used as its Old Testament, included all of the deuterocanonical books."" —*[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books)*
- Anglicans and Episcopalians read from the Apocrypha in the lectionary and the *[[~1662 Book of Common Prayer|Book of Common Prayer]]* (*[A Brief History of the Apocrypha - Westminster Theological SeminaryWestminster Theological Seminary](https://faculty.wts.edu/posts/a-brief-history-of-the-apocrypha/)*)

### Highlights of the Deuterocanonical Books 
- Always be faithful to God, even when you seem to be in an impossible position. God rescues now (as he did Susanna in [[Dn-13]]), and preserves for eternity (as he did the seven brothers and their mother in [[2 Mc-07]]).
