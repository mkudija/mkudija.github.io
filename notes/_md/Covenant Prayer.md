# Covenant Prayer
*by Michael Stalcup (from [First Things 2020-10](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/10/covenant-prayer))* 

I am no longer mine but wholly yours,
so wield me as you will: assign my rank
among the great or small; fling wide the doors
to honor or humiliation, thanks
or accusation—take my hand and lead
me through; permit me influence and fame
or have me follow you unseen and freed
from weights I cannot bear—but let your name
be glorified; spare me from suffering
or let it shape me; bless or break my plans;
extend my days or martyr me; I bring
my life into your scarred and sovereign hands.
Whatever comes, my heart will rest content
for you are mine—your blood my covenant.
