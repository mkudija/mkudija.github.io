## Ice Ice Baby
#lyrics *by Vanilla Ice*

Yo, VIP, let's kick it!  
  
Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby  
  
All right stop, Collaborate and listen  
Ice is back with my brand new invention  
Something grabs a hold of me tightly  
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly  
Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know  
Turn off the lights and I'll glow  
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal  
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.  
  
Dance, go rush the speaker that booms  
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom  
Deadly, when I play a dope melody  
Anything less than the best is a felony[^excellent]
Love it or leave it, you better gangway  
You better hit bull's eye, the kid don't play  

[^excellent]: cf. [[1 Cor-12#v31]]

If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it  
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it  
  
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  
  
Now that the party is jumping  
With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumpin'  
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking  
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon  
Burning them they ain't quick and nimble  
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal  
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo  
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo  
Rollin' in my 5.0  
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow  
The girlies on standby, waving just to say, "Hi!"  
Did you stop? No, I just drove by  
Kept on pursuing to the next stop  
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block  
That block was dead Yo  
So I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.  
  
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis  
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis  
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine  
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine  
Ready for the chumps on the wall  
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of "Eight Ball"  
Gunshots ranged out like a bell  
I grabbed my nine, all I heard was shells  
Falling on the concrete real fast  
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas  
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed  
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack  
Police on the scene, you know what I mean  
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends  
  
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it  
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it  
  
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  
  
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet  
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it  
My town, that created all the bass sound  
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground  
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill  
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel  
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept  
We make it hype and you want to step with this  
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja  
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJs say, "Damn."  
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram  
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose  
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice  
  
If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it!  
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it.  
  
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla  
  
Yo, man, let's get out of here! Word to your mother!  
  
Ice Ice Baby Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold  
Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold
