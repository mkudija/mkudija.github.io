## Notes
### Volume I
- Vol. I, pg. 1286: [[Friendship]] of [[St. Basil the Great]] and [[St. Gregory Nazianzen]]: "We seemed to be two bodies with a single spirit...Our single object and ambition was virtue."  ^47e634

### Volume II
- Vol. II, pg. 1794: from the *[[~The Dialogue]]* of [[St. Catherine of Siena]]: "You are a mystery as deep as the sea; the more I search, the more I find, and the more I find the more I search for you. But I can never be satisfied; what I receive will ever leave me desiring more. When you fill my soul I have an even greater hunger, and I grow more famished for your light. I desire above all to see you, the true light, as you really are."
