## Notes

### Volume I
- Apostolic Constitution 
	- "The Liturgy of the Hours was seen as a kind of necessary complement to the fullness of divine worship that is contained in the eucharistic sacrifice, by means of which that worship might overflow to reach all the hours of daily life." (11)
	- "The result was that [[~Sacrosanctum concilium|the Council]] treated the liturgy as a whole, and the Hours in particular, with such thoroughness and skill, such spirituality and power, that there is scarcely a parallel to it in the entire history of the Church." (13)
	- "It is supremely to be hoped that the Liturgy of the Hours may pervade and penetrate the whole of Christian prayer, giving it life, direction and expression and effectively nourishing the spiritual life of the people of God." (16)
	- "To manifest this quality of our prayer more clearly, 'the warm and living love for holy Scripture' which is the atmosphere of the Liturgy of the Hours must come to life in all of us, so that Scripture may indeed become the chief source of all Christian payer." (17, cf. *[[~Sacrosanctum concilium|SC]]* 24)
	- "[[Mental Prayer]] should draw unlimited nourishment from readings, psalms, and the other parts of the Liturgy of the Hours." (18)
	- "The Hours are recommended to all Christ's faithful members, including those who are not bound by law to their recitation." (18)
- [[2025-01-28-General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours|General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours]]
- Vol. I, pg. 405 ([[2024-12-25-Wed]] Office of Readings for Christmas, from a Sermon by [[St. Leo the Great]]): "Christian, remember your dignity, and now that you share in God's own nature, do not return by sin to your former base condition. Bear in mind who is your head and of whose body you are a member. Do not forget that you have been rescued from the power of darkness and brought into the light of God's kingdom. Through the sacrament of baptism you have become a temple of the Holy Spirit. Do not drive away so great a guest by evil conduct and become again a slave to the devil, for your liberty was bought by the blood of Christ." 
- Vol. I, pg. 831 ([[2022-12-05-Mon]] Evening Prayer of Monday of the Second Week of Advent): "When you took on flesh, Lord Jesus, you made a marriage of mankind with God." 
- Vol. I, pg. 902 ([[2022-12-09-Fri]] Evening Prayer of Friday of the Second Week of Advent): "We must endure many trials before entering the God's kingdom", or "through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God" ([[Acts-14#v22]], RSVCE)
- Vol. I, pg. 1067 ([[2025-12-22-Mon]] Monday Office of Readings)—[[Ps-73]]: "What else have I in heaven but you? Apart from you I want nothing on earth. My body and my heart faint for joy; God is my possession for ever. All those who abandon you shall perish; you will destroy all those who are faithless. To be near God is my happiness." (cf. *[[2026-02-09-The Holy Spirit (Martínez)|The Holy Spirit]]*)
- Vol. I, pg. 1286 ([[2022-03-14-Mon]]): [[Friendship]] of [[St. Basil the Great]] and [[St. Gregory Nazianzen]]: "We seemed to be two bodies with a single spirit...Our single object and ambition was virtue."  ^47e634

### Volume II
- Vol. II, pg. 63 ([[2023-03-01-Wed]] prayer for the Thursday after Ash Wednesday):
>Lord, 
>may everything we do
>begin with your inspiration,
>continue with your help,
>and reach perfection under your guidance.
>We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
>who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
>God, for ever and ever.
>Amen.

- Vol. II, pg. 180 ([[2025-03-20-Thu]]), pg. 307 ([[2024-03-20-Wed]]): intentions for Morning Prayer for Wednesday of the Fourth Week of Lent:
>Help us to receive good things from your bounty with a deep sense of gratitude, and to accept with patience the evil that comes to us.
>Teach us to be loving not only in great and exceptional moments, but above all in the ordinary events of daily life.
>May we abstain from what we do not really need, and help our brothers and sisters in distress.
>May we bear the wounds of your Son, for through his body he gave us life.

- Vol. II, pg. 791 ([[2025-05-15-Thu]]): Why is Good Friday "good"? Because: "in restoring human nature you have given us a greater dignity than we had in the beginning." 
- Vol. II, pg. 1335 ([[2025-01-28-Tue]]): from a conference by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]: "If you seek [[patience]], you will find no better example than the cross. Great patience occurs in two ways: either when one patiently suffers much, or whe none suffers things which one is able to avoid and yet does not avoid."
- Vol. II, pg. 1794 ([[2022-05-05-Thu]]): from the *[[~The Dialogue|The Dialogue]]* of [[St. Catherine of Siena]]: "You are a mystery as deep as the sea; the more I search, the more I find, and the more I find the more I search for you. But I can never be satisfied; what I receive will ever leave me desiring more. When you fill my soul I have an even greater hunger, and I grow more famished for your light. I desire above all to see you, the true light, as you really are."

### Volume III
- Vol. III, pg. 1573 ([[2022-08-16-Tue]]): from the catechetical instructions by [[St. John Vianney]]: "The Christian's treasure is not on earth but in heaven. Our thoughts, then, ought to be directed to where our treasure is.[^treasure] This is the glorious duty of man: to pray and to love. If you pray and love, that is where a man's happiness lies. [[Prayer]] is nothing else but union with God...We had become unworthy to pray, but God in his goodness allowed us to speak with him. Our prayers are incense that gives him the greatest pleasure. My little children, your hearts are small, but prayer stretches them and makes them capable of loving God. Through prayer we receive a foretaste of heaven and something of paradise comes down upon us. Prayer never leaves us without sweetness. It is honey that flows into the soul and makes all things sweet.[^honey] When we pray properly, sorrows disappear like snow before the sun."
- Vol. III, pg. 812 ([[2023-08-17-Thu]]): "May the fire of your word consume our sins and its brightness illumine our hearts."
- Vol. III, pg. 1333 ([[2026-01-27-Tue]] Office of Readings, from the Spiritual Testament by Saint Angela Merici): "Mothers of children, even if they have a thousand, carry each and every one fixed in their hearts, and because of the strength of their love they do not forget any of them. In fact, it seems that the more children they have the more their love and care for each one is increased...I beg you again, strive to draw them by love, modesty, charity, and not by pride and harshness. Be sincerely kind to every one according to the words of our Lord: Learn of me, for I am meek and humble of heart." 

[^treasure]: cf. [[Mt-06#v21]]: "For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be."

[^honey]: cf. [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]]: "Jesus to me is honey in the mouth, music in the ear, a song in the heart." ([[St. Bernard of Clairvaux|Bernard of Clairvaux]], *On the Song of Songs*, vol. I, sermon 15, no. 6, quoted in [[Ralph Martin]], *[[2022-12-30-The Fulfillment of All Desire|The Fulfillment of All Desire]]*, 136)

### Volume IV
- Vol. IV, pg. 222 ([[2025-09-07-Sun]]: Office of Readings for the Twenty-Third Sunday in Ordinary Time, from a sermon on the beatitudes by [[St. Leo the Great]]): "What you long for will be given you; what you love will be yours forever."
- Vol. IV, pg. 409 ([[2024-10-19-Sat]]: Office of Readings for the Twenty-Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time, from a letter to Proba by [[St. Augustine]]): "Why he should ask us to pray, when he knows what we need before we ask him, may perplex us if we do not realize that our Lord and God does not want to know what we want (for he cannot fail to know it) but **wants us rather to exercise our desire through our prayers, so that we may be able to receive what he is preparing to give us**. His gift is very great indeed, but our capacity is too small and limited to receive it. That is why we are told: *Enlarge your desires, do not bear the yoke with unbelievers.*" ^a7495d
- Vol. IV, pg. 421 ([[2025-10-22-Wed]] Office of Readings, from a letter to Proba by [[St. Augustine]]): "If you study every word of the petitions of Scripture, you will find, I think, nothing that is not contained and included in the [[Our Father|Lord's Prayer]]. When we pray, then, we may use different words to say the same things, but we may not say different things."
- Vol. IV, pg. 526 ([[2025-11-14-Fri]] Office of Readings, from a homily written in the second century): "[[Fasting]] is better than prayer, but [[almsgiving]] surpasses both, for *love covers a multitude of sins.* Nevertheless, prayer delivers the soul from death if it proceeds from a good conscience."
- Vol. IV, pg. 589-90 ([[2025-11-24-Mon]] Office of Readings, from a sermon by [[St. Leo the Great]]) on [[Almsgiving]]: "But those who enjoy the things that are above and eternal rather than earthly and perishable, possess an in-corruptible, hidden store of which the prophet speaks: *Our treasure and salvation have come, wisdom and instruction and piety from the Lord: these are the treasures of justice*. Through these, with the help of God's grace, even earthly possessions are transformed into heavenly blessings; it is a fact that many people use the wealth which is either rightfully left to them or otherwise acquired, as a tool of devotion. By distributing what might be superfluous to support the poor, they are amassing imperishable riches, so that what they have discreetly given cannot be subject to loss. They have properly placed those riches where their heart is; it is a most blessed thing to work to increase such riches rather than to fear that they may pass away."
- Vol. IV, pg. 592 ([[2025-11-25-Tue]] Office of Readings, from a treatise on John by [[St. Augustine]]): *The Scriptures are a means to an end:* "When that day is at hand, the prophet will not be read to us, the book of the Apostle will not be opened, we shall not require the testimony of John, we shall have no need of the Gospel itself. Therefore all Scriptures will be taken away from us, those Scriptures which in the night of this world burned like lamps so that we might not remain in darkness."
- Vol. IV, pg. 596 ([[2025-11-26-Wed]] Office of Readings, from a homily attributed to Saint Macarius, bishop): "Woe to the soul without Christ as its true pilot."
- Vol. IV, pg. 599 ([[2025-11-27-Thu]] Office of Readings, from a homily on Matthew by [[St. John Chrysostom]]): on [[justification]]—"The Lord, however, does want them to contribute something, lest everything seem to be the work of grace, and they seem to win their reward without deserving it." 
- Vol. IV, pg. 605 ([[2025-11-28-Fri]]): "There, the merciful are rewarded, those who fulfilled the demands of justice by [[almsgiving|providing for the poor]]. In obedience to the Lord's command, they turned their earthly patrimony into heavenly treasure."
- Vol. IV, pg. 832 ([[2025-09-01-Mon]]): "Lord Jesus, grant that all men be saved, and come to the knowledge of truth." (cf. [[Universalism]], [[1 Thes-02#v10]] but not annotated in *[[~Liturgy and Life Study Bible|Liturgy and Life Study Bible]]*)
- Vol. IV, pg. 834 ([[2025-09-30-Tue]]): [[Ps-37]]—"Calm your [[anger]] and forget your rage; do not fret, it only leads to evil."
- Vol. IV, pg. 844 ([[2025-09-02-Tue]]: "Lord Jesus Christ, true light of the world, you guide all mankind to salvation." (cf. [[Universalism]])
- Vol. IV, pg. 879 ([[2023-08-14-Mon]]): "Let your faithful ones seek and taste the things that are above, and let them direct their work and their leisure to your glory."
- Vol. IV, pg. 960 ([[2022-10-14-Fri]]): "We give thanks to God whose power is revealed in nature, and whose providence is revealed in history."
- Vol. IV, pg. 1073 ([[2023-08-21-Mon]] Saturday Morning Prayer Week III): "May the fire of your word consume our sins and its brightness illumine our hearts."
- Vol. IV, pg. 1401 ([[2025-09-15-Mon]] Office of Readings for Our Lady of Sorrows, from a sermon by [[St. Bernard]]): "Truly, O blessed Mother, a sword has pierced your heart. For only by passing through your heart could the sword enter the flesh of your Son."
- Vol. IV, pg. 1448 ([[2024-09-30-Mon]] Office of Readings for [[St. Jerome]], from the prologue of the commentary on Isaiah): "I interpret as I should, following the command of Christ: *Search the Scriptures*, and *Seek and you shall find*. Christ will not say to me what he said to the Jews: *You erred, not knowing the Scriptures and now knowing the power of God.* For if, as Paul says, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God, and if the man who does not know Scripture does not know the power and wisdom of God, then **ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ**...No one should think that I mean to explain the entire subject matter of this great book of Scripture in one brief sermon, since it contains all the mysteries of the Lord."
- Vol. IV, pg. 1161 ([[2023-09-04-Mon]] intercessions for Wednesday Morning Prayer Week IV): "Give us strength in temptation, endurance in trial, and gratitude in prosperity."
- Vol. IV, pg. 1148 ([[2024-08-20-Tue]]), [[Col-03#v16]]: "Let the word of Christ, rich as it is, dwell in you."
- Vol. IV, pg. 1415 ([[2025-09-19-Fri]] Office of Readings from a sermon by [[St. Augustine]], applies to [[fatherhood]]): "But even if feeding his sheep could repay him for redeeming me, what could repay him for having made me his shepherd? To be a good shepherd I depend entirely on his grace, for without his help I should be a very bad one, there is so much evil in me. Pray, then, that I may not be a bad shepherd, but a good one. And for you, my brothers, *I also pray and warn you against failing to cooperate with the grace you receive from God*. Make my ministry a fruitful one. You are God's garden, and you should therefore welcome the laborer who does the visible work of planting and watering the seed, even though the growth comes from one who works invisibly within you. Help me both by your prayers and by your obedience, for then it will be a pleasure for me, not to preside over you, but to serve you."
- Vol. IV, pg. 1424 ([[2025-09-27-Sat]] Office of Readings from a writing by [[St. Vincent de Paul]]): "If you consider the poor in the light of faith, then you will observe that they are taking the place of the Son of God who chose to be poor…Since God surely loves the poor, he also loves those who love the poor…It is our duty to prefer [[Almsgiving|the service of the poor]] to everything else and to offer such service as quickly as possible."
