# Trinity Sunday
*by [[George Herbert]]*

Lord, who hast formed me out of mud,  
    And hast redeem'd me through thy blood,  
    And sanctifi'd me to do good;  
  
Purge all my sins done heretofore;  
    For I confess my heavy score,  
    And I will strive to sin no more.  
  
Enrich my heart, mouth, hands in me,  
    With faith, with hope, with charity;  
    That I may run, rise, rest with thee.
