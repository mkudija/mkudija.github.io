# Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof...

"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, <br>but only say the word and $\begin{Bmatrix} \text{my soul} \\ \text{your servant} \end{Bmatrix}$ shall be healed."

[[Mt-08#v8|Matthew 8:8]]: "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and **my servant** will be healed."

*[[~Roman Missal|The Roman Missal]]*: "Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and **my soul** shall be healed."

I think this alternative gives a complementary meaning: "Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and **your servant** shall be healed."
