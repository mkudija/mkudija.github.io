# Love (III)
*by [[George Herbert]]*

Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back,
                              Guilty of dust and sin.
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
                             From my first entrance in,
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,
                             If I lacked any thing.  
  
"A guest," I answered, "worthy to be here."
                             Love said, "You shall be he."
"I the unkind, ungrateful? Ah my dear,
                             I cannot look on thee."
Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,  
                             "Who made the eyes but I?"
   
"Truth Lord, but I have marred them; let my shame
                             Go where it doth deserve." 
"And know you not," says Love, "who bore the blame?"
                             "My dear, then I will serve."
"You must sit down," says Love, "and taste my meat."
                             So I did sit and eat.
