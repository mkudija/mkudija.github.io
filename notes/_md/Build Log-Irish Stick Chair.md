	- 2022-07-05 - complete less finish

## Design
This is the first chair I've build, so I went with a simple design. It is patterned off the "Simple Irish-y Armchair" by [[Christopher Schwarz]] from *[[~The Stick Chair Book|The Stick Chair Book]]*.

I built this before reading *[[~The Stick Chair Book|The Stick Chair Book]]* so that I'll have some practical knowledge to throw the theory up against. I learned what I needed to know to build this chair from various resources on the [Lost Art Press Blog](https://blog.lostartpress.com/):
- Patterned off the "Simple Irish-y Armchair" by [[Christopher Schwarz]] from *[[~The Stick Chair Book|The Stick Chair Book]]*

	- [Irish-Chair-stats.jpg](https://blog.lostartpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Irish-Chair-stats.jpg) (has angles and cut list: this was my primary shop reference while building and the only change I would make is to cut the legs longer)

>This Irish-inspired stick chair is built specifically for reading and relaxing. With a back that is pitched at 28°, a seat that tilts back at 4° and the sweeping curved backrest, this is one of the most comfortable wooden chairs I make.
>The seat is 16” off the floor, which is 2” lower than a chair for keyboarding, though I don’t find the chair difficult to get out of. The overall height of the chair is 31”.

## Materials Required

| Material      | Quantity             | Description                                                                                                     |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Walnut**    | ~15 board-feet       | ~$20–50, used walnut I had on hand, one 7'x6" 8/4 board and a couple of 6'x7" 4/4 boards                        |
| **Hide Glue** | 1 bottle             | $10, Titebond Liquid Hide Glue, 8-Ounces #5013                                                                  |
| **Finish**    | 1 pint (tiny amount) | $25, [Tried & True Original Wood Finish](https://www.triedandtruewoodfinish.com/products/original-wood-finish/) |

I probably paid a total of $20–50 for the wood used when I bought a number of scraps from a millworks and cabinet shop. This would have been more like $100–200 if I had bought it by itself new.

## Tools Used
- Miter saw
- Table saw
- Band saw
- Jack plane
- Block plane
- Scrub plane (first use)
- Handheld drill
- Mill / drill press
- New chairmanning tools:
	- Grizzly Industrial H7693 - Deep Plug Cutter 6 Pc. Set, [Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E305CQ)
	- BOSCH Daredevil DSBE1012 12-Inch Drill Bit Extension, [Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BYOWKM)
	- Deburring External Chamfer Tool, [Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S1G5WH4) (I don't recommend this as it is too small to do much good, just use a belt sander and drawknife)

### Process Notes
- Seat
	- Cut boards (8/4)
	- Joint edges
	- Cut biscuits
	- Glue up
	- Scrub plane to clean up joints
	- Clean up / chamfer edges
- Sticks
	- cut square sticks on table saw (4/4)
	- build octagonal planing jig
	- plane to octagons with jig and with jack plane
	- taper ends with belt sander to start tenon cutter
	- cut tenons
	- drawknife to blend shaft down to tenons
	- clean up edges with jack plane
	- cut wedge kerf on bandsaw
- Legs
	- cut pieces (4/4)
	- glue up two pieces into leg blank
	- make table saw octagonal jig
	- cut to octagons on table saw
	- taper ends with drawknife
	- cut tenons
	- cut wedge kerf on bandsaw
- Drill holes
	- Layout hole pattern and sightlines on seat
	- Set bevel to 20º for backrest and drill three middle holes
	- Rough install backrest and use hole locations to drill angles for outboard sticks (should have used a template for this, as it resulted in the wrong angle and the need for a backrest doubler)
	- Drill leg holes (I drilled 3 of 4 the opposite direction, so had to re-drill the other way and go back and plug them)
- Armrests
	- cut and plane
	- build ~9" high rectangle clamping jig to hold arms
	- with armrests clamped, drill through armrest and then through seat using drill extension
	- plane down sticks to accept armrest hole
- Backrest
	- Cut, plane, drill three middle holes on mill (damaged the first one which became the back doubler)
	- Mark angles and drill outside holes freehand (resulted in one blow-out from not centered, should clamp a block on either side)
	- Trim down damaged piece, plug hole, and glue up with main backrest
- Assembly
	- Make wedges on band saw, trim to width as needed
	- Glue up legs and install wedges
	- Level legs on kitchen island and cut to length
	- Bevel end of legs (feet?)
	- Flush cut tenons and wedges on top side of seat
	- Final plane seat with scrub plane (surfaces) and Jack plane (chamfers)
	- Glue up sticks, armrests, backrest; install wedges
	- Flush cut wedges on back underside
	- Cut armrest wedges/tenons proud; clean up with chisel
- Hand sand with a 380 grid disc pad
- Finish with Tried & True Original Traditionnel applied with an old t-shirt
