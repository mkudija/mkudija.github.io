# Brothers
*by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]*

How lovely the elder brother’s  
Life all laced in the other’s,  
Lóve-laced!—what once I well  
Witnessed; so fortune fell.  
When Shrovetide, two years gone,  
Our boys’ plays brought on  
Part was picked for John,  
Young Jóhn: then fear, then joy  
Ran revel in the elder boy.  
Their night was come now; all  
Our company thronged the hall;  
Henry, by the wall,  
Beckoned me beside him:  
I came where called, and eyed him  
By meanwhiles; making my play  
Turn most on tender byplay.  
For, wrung all on love’s rack,  
My lad, and lost in Jack,  
Smiled, blushed, and bit his lip;  
Or drove, with a diver’s dip,  
Clutched hands down through clasped knees—  
Truth’s tokens tricks like these,  
Old telltales, with what stress  
He hung on the imp’s success.  
Now the other was bráss-bóld:  
Hé had no work to hold  
His heart up at the strain;  
Nay, roguish ran the vein.  
Two tedious acts were past;  
Jack’s call and cue at last;  
When Henry, heart-forsook,  
Dropped eyes and dared not look.  
Eh, how áll rúng!  
Young dog, he did give tongue!  
But Harry—in his hands he has flung  
His tear-tricked cheeks of flame  
For fond love and for shame.  
 Ah Nature, framed in fault,  
There’s comfort then, there’s salt;[^salt]  
Nature, bad, base, and blind,  
Dearly thou canst be kind;  
There dearly thén, deárly,  
I’ll cry thou canst be kind.

[^salt]: cf. [[Mt-05#v13]]
