<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->

<h1 id="bible-reviews">Bible Reviews</h1>

<p><em><a href="../reading-notes/2022-12-03-Dei-Verbum.html">Dei Verbum</a></em> reminds us that "The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures just as she venerates the body of the Lord." A good Bible (or several) is an important tool for prayer and study. Below are notes on some of my favorite Bibles. </p>

<p>The first consideration in selecting a Bible is the translation. You will notice that all or most of the Bibles below are in the Tyndale-KJV lineage, which I recommend and appreciate for their historical and linguistic significance, scholarly merit, and wide ecumenical use (see <a href="Bible-Translation-Chart.html">Bible Translation Chart</a>). The topic of Bible translation is fascinating: I might recommend books such as <em><a href="../reading-notes/2023-05-24-The-Art-of-Bible-Translation.html">The Art of Bible Translation</a></em>, <em><a href="../reading-notes/2023-05-13-Bible-Translation-&amp;-the-Making-of-the-ESV-Catholic-Edition.html">Bible Translation &amp; the Making of the ESV Catholic Edition</a></em>, and <em><a href="../reading-notes/2025-07-06-The-King-James-Bible-A-Short-History-from-Tyndale-to-Today.html">The King James Bible: A Short History from Tyndale to Today</a></em> to learn more. </p>

<p>The physical attributes of a Bible are also important. This includes factors such as how the text is typeset, how the Bible is bound, what quality of paper is used, and how the size lends itself to use. Many Bibles are available, and all make tradeoffs across these and other dimensions and cost more or less as a result. There is no perfect Bible, but some Bibles are better for some purposes than others: I included some <strong style="color: white; background-color: #5B7894; border: none; padding: 0px 8px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; margin: 1px 0px; border-radius: 14px; font-size: .8em;">tags</strong> to indicate stand-out Bibles in various categories. </p>

<p>One final consideration is that you will tend to read, study, and pray with a Bible more if you enjoy doing so. This is one reason to invest in a Bible of durable craftsmanship and materials with an attractive layout. </p>

<p>In addition to the Bibles below, there are a few on my <a href="Bible-Wishlist.html">Bible Wishlist</a> I hope to be published in the future.</p>

<p>This little New Testament is in my pocket most days and has been since I got it in mid-2023. It is a great companion for Mass, especially for daily masses with a NT reading. Even when not used, it is a continual reminder in my pocket next to my phone. Dr. Bergsma also promotes carrying a New Testament with you, for example <a href="https://youtu.be/E_rjxyyRJBM?t=3615">here</a>. </p>

This is perhaps the single best Bible study resource for Catholics. It lives on my desk and I frequently refer to it. The notes focus on the content and unity of Scripture which is read in the living tradition of the Church and with the analogy of faith. The only downside is its physical immensity: it is best suited for desk reference, but the individual booklets are useful for travel. </p>

<p><strong style="color: white; background-color: #5B7894; border: none; padding: 0px 8px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; margin: 1px 0px; border-radius: 14px; font-size: .8em;">My Everday Bible</strong><br />
The Cambridge Diadem has been my everyday Bible since mid-2023: it uses the ESV translation,^[esv] is a beautiful premium Bible, and is an easily portable size. This is the Bible I mark up and most commonly bring with me to Church or to teach from, and it is the Bible I use for the <a href="Scripture-Memory-System-for-your-Bible.html">Scripture Memory System for your Bible</a>. </p>

<p>^[esv]: See <em><a href="../reading-notes/2023-05-13-Bible-Translation-&amp;-the-Making-of-the-ESV-Catholic-Edition.html">Bible Translation &amp; the Making of the ESV Catholic Edition</a></em></p>

<p>Schuyler Bibles are exquisite works of craftsmanship and this is the most beautiful Bible I own. I did a full review here: <a href="Bible-Review-Schuyler-Quentel-ESV-with-Apocrypha.html">Bible Review-Schuyler Quentel ESV with Apocrypha</a>. I just wish it was smaller—while the size lets you fit a piece of paper folded in half inside the cover, it is larger than I prefer for everyday use. </p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsgithubcommkudijamkudijagithubiotreemasterreading-notes_mdthe-great-adventure-catholic-biblemdthe-great-adventure-catholic-biblea-rsv2ce"><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Great Adventure Catholic Bible.md">The Great Adventure Catholic Bible</a> (RSV2CE)</h3>

<p>The Great Adventure Bible is one of the more popular Catholic Bibles and for good reason: it is a great value and a great all-around Bible, though with some notable shortcomings. I have the first edition, which has some annoying design choices that have partially been fixed in the second edition typeset by 2K/Denmark. The most useful feature is the colored tabs for easily navigating to the desired book. The new premium edition appears to be a great choice, though I cannot recommend it until they remove the awful embossed logo on the cover which ruins what is otherwise an excellent Bible. </p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsgithubcommkudijamkudijagithubiotreemasterreading-notes_mdnew-cambridge-paragraph-bible-with-apocryphamdnew-cambridge-paragraph-biblea-kjv"><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha.md">New Cambridge Paragraph Bible</a> (KJV)</h3>

<p><strong style="color: white; background-color: #5B7894; border: none; padding: 0px 8px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; margin: 1px 0px; border-radius: 14px; font-size: .8em;">Best KJV</strong><br />
The New Cambridge Paragraph Bible is a fresh KJV for two reasons. First, it faithfully presents the original intentions of the 1611 translators while dusting off the text for a modern reader.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-kjv"><a href="#fn-kjv">1</a></sup> Second, it is beautifully typeset in a paragraph setting making it a joy to sit down and read. Because I do not read from the KJV primarily I have only the hardcover edition with paper that suffers from some minor ghosting. Regardless, this is my go-to KJV for reference or reading to the children.</p>

The small size and zipper closure of the Compact Ignatius Bible makes it a great travel companion. I prefer the removal of thee's and thou's in the RSV2CE to the RSVCE, but Oxford also makes a version of this Bible in the NABRE. This Bible has gone with me camping in the wilderness and on a pilgrimage to Rome, and I used it to prototype my ideas for a <a href="The-Case-for-a-Lectionary-Bible.html">Lectionary Bible</a>.</p>

<p>The Navarre Bible comes in ten volumes. I have only the Pentateuch and Gospels/Acts, but I refer to it often for its copious and excellent spiritual and theological notes. It also includes the text of the Latin Vulgate.</p>
