vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes

Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos

<h1 id="the-case-for-a-lectionary-bible">The Case for a Lectionary Bible</h1>

<div class="info"> <p><em>This was published here on 2025-03-13, and on <a href="https://catholicbibletalk.com/2025/03/the-case-for-a-lectionary-bible-guest-post-by-matthew-kudija/" target="_blank">Catholic Bible Talk</a> on 2025-03-28.</em></p> </div> 

<p>At the top of my Bible wishlist is a Lectionary Bible: a portable Bible annotated with the Lectionary readings at Mass for the 3-year Sunday cycle and 2-year weekday cycle. Such a Bible, once it exists, will be a valuable aid to the study of Scripture and living of the Liturgical life of the Church by keeping the Bible and the Mass in close relationship to each other and facilitating our reception of the Word in both Scripture and Eucharist. </p>

<h4 id="why-a-lectionary-bible">Why a Lectionary Bible</h4>

<p>The Bible and the liturgy are intimately connected. We must resist the temptation to view them separately, and further seek to understand and live them together.</p>

<p>The liturgy is the natural habitat of the Bible. And the liturgy is where the tradition of interpreting the scriptures lives. The Bible forms most of the words of the liturgy, and the Bible itself (the canon of scripture) grew out of what is read in the liturgy. We simply cannot have one without the other<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-ls1"><a href="#fn-ls1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The Lectionary Bible is an aid to <em>living</em> the Bible and the liturgy together. At its core, it is a Bible just like any other Bible. In addition to the Biblical text, annotations in the side margins indicate which readings make up the Lectionary to visually indicate the relationship between the two. </p>

<h4 id="using-the-lectionary-bible">Using the Lectionary Bible</h4>

<p>The Lectionary Bible facilitates what you could call a "two-way reading" of scripture. This means first celebrating the liturgy with a greater awareness of the big picture of the Bible, and second, engaging in personal study of scripture with the liturgy in mind. </p>

<p>The Lectionary itself—or and any missal one might ordinarily use at Mass—places the readings for the day next to each other. This is convenient, but at the cost of isolating the readings from their context. Reading the Lectionary from a full Bible gives one perspective and builds a sense of the "content and unity of the whole of Scripture"<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-dv12"><a href="#fn-dv12">2</a></sup>. The Lectionary Bible is your companion at daily Mass to help you live the liturgy from the Bible.</p>

<p>In the other direction, when studying the Bible it is instructive to be aware of the placement of a particular text in the Lectionary. The Church pulls more heavily from some portions of scripture than others in the Lectionary, and making this visible helps you to slow down in the richest passages when reading through the whole Bible. This connects personal scripture study to the Liturgy and allows you to be led by the Church's tradition, which lives in the liturgy and is the living interpretation of scripture<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-ls2"><a href="#fn-ls2">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="design-of-the-lectionary-bible">Design of the Lectionary Bible</h4>

<p>I first looked for an existing lectionary Bible, and the closest design I have been able to find is the <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Whirl Lectionary NRSV Bible.md">Whirl Lectionary NRSV Bible</a></em>. This Bible is designed for the third through sixth grade Whirl Sunday school curriculum and published by Sparkhouse, a ministry of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Every reading in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Common_Lectionary">Revised Common Lectionary</a>, a version of the Vatican II Lectionary adapted by many Protestant denominations, is highlighted in this Bible using different colors corresponding to the liturgical season. Up to two different overlapping readings can be annotated with this design by applying a gradient to the background shading, as in John 16:12-15 in the photo.</p>

<p>Despite its shortcomings—in addition to not being the Catholic Lectionary, it is by no means a portable or sturdy Bible you would regularly bring to Mass—this Bible was helpful for thinking through the design of a Lectionary Bible, and I prefer the shading of the text if it could be designed in a way to accommodate the full Lectionary.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/mkudija/img/blob/main/2025-03-05_lectionary-Bible/whirl-5.png?raw=true" width="100%"><br />
<center><strong>Whirl Lectionary NRSV Bible</strong>: The Revised Common Lectionary is highlighted using different colors corresponding to the liturgical season.</center></p>

<p>There is also the <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Liturgy and Life Study Bible.md">Liturgy and Life Study Bible</a></em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-ll"><a href="#fn-ll">4</a></sup> which details how the Bible is used not just in the Mass but in the other liturgies of the Catholic Church, such as the <a href="Liturgy-of-the-Hours.html">Liturgy of the Hours</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Gradual">Romand Gradual</a>. It is beautifully designed by 2KDenmark. It is an "indispensable resource"<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-just"><a href="#fn-just">5</a></sup> for detailed study, but certainly not a Bible you would bring to Mass with you—the page from Luke 1 in the photo is typical of frequently proclaimed texts in that most of the page is taken up by the reference apparatus. The visual design of the apparatus and inclusion of other liturgical texts is also better suited to detailed study: the design is not visually helpful in seeing how the lectionary and Bible interact, apart from the (still useful) note above about getting a sense for how often a text is proclaimed by how little room is left for it at the top of the page. </p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/mkudija/img/blob/main/2025-03-05_lectionary-Bible/liturgy-and-life.png?raw=true" width="100%"><br />
<center><strong>Liturgy and Life Study Bible</strong>: An essential resource for detailed study of the use of scripture in the liturgies of the Catholic Church.</center></p>

<p>My first prototype of the Lectionary Bible consisted of marginal annotations in the <a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Ignatius Catholic Bible.md">Compact Ignatius Catholic Bible</a>. This Bible is quite portable and durable making it a great testbed with which to iterate on the Lectionary Bible design.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/mkudija/img/blob/main/2025-03-05_lectionary-Bible/lectionary_bible_zipper.png?raw=true" width="100%"><br />
<center><strong>Prototype Lectionary Bible</strong>: Annotations in the Compact Ignatius Catholic Bible</center></p>

<p>A second prototype digitizes this idea of annotating the Lectionary in the outer margins of the text to visually indicate passages that are proclaimed in the Mass. Colors in this version correspond to the Lectionary cycle: A/B/C for Sundays, Feasts, and Weekdays. Alternatively they could be colored by liturgical season. </p>

<p>Luke 1 is a useful "high-density" text that is proclaimed frequently in the Lectionary. This design demonstrates the ability to clearly indicate overlapping readings used in multiple locations in the Lectionary. Alternatively, a creative graphic designer could likely produce a design that uses shaded text like the <em>Whirl Bible</em> rather than sidebars while still displaying the full Letionary.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/mkudija/img/blob/main/2025-03-05_lectionary-Bible/lectionary-bible-prototype-2.png?raw=true" width="100%"><br />
<center><strong>Prototype Lectionary Bible Design</strong>: Color-coded side bars indicate the passages in the Lectionary.</center></p>

<p>Further design elements to enable the intended purpose of the Lectionary Bible of <em>living</em> the connection between the liturgy and scripture include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Portable</strong>: Dimensions not to exceed a compact Bible or typical breviary or missal, approximately 5" by 7" and not more than 2" thick (these are the approximate dimensions of <em><a href="Liturgy-of-the-Hours.html">Liturgy of the Hours, Volume II</a></em>, and the same footprint as the <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~Ignatius Catholic Bible.md">Compact Ignatius Catholic Bible</a></em> which has a thickness of about 1.25").</li>
<li><strong>Durable</strong>: Smyth sewn binding, hardcover or zipper cover, durable paper—this is the Bible you bring to Mass with you every day.</li>
<li><strong>Navigable</strong>: Includes a detailed table of Lectionary readings and 4 ribbons to mark the First Reading, Psalm, Second Reading (on Sundays and Feasts), and Gospel for the day. Also printed tabs for each book of the Bible to navigate directly from the outside (similar to <em><a href="https://github.com/mkudija/mkudija.github.io/tree/master/reading-notes/_md/~The Great Adventure Catholic Bible.md">The Great Adventure Bible</a></em>).</li>
<li><strong>Translation</strong>: A natural choice for the translation is the forthcoming (as of 2025) "liturgical Bible" update to the NABRE when it becomes available so that it "substantially matches" what you hear in the Lectionary<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-nabre"><a href="#fn-nabre">6</a></sup>. If that is not possible, a viable alternative would be the RSV2CE<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-translation"><a href="#fn-translation">7</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Extras</strong>: Other features would be minimal to facilitate portability (minimal footnotes, no cross-references, no book introductions, etc.)<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-extra"><a href="#fn-extra">8</a></sup>. However, a detailed tabular lectionary and introduction would be included.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-golden-age-of-bibles">A Golden Age of Bibles</h4>

<p>We live in a golden age of Bible scholarship and publishing. There has perhaps never been a better time in the Church's history for a lay English-speaking Catholic to study and live Sacred Scripture. Catholic Biblical scholarship has been spurred by landmark statements such as Vatican II's <em><a href="../reading-notes/2022-12-03-Dei-Verbum.html">Dei Verbum</a></em> and Pope Benedict XVI's <em><a href="../reading-notes/2023-01-31-Verbum-Domini.html">Verbum Domini</a></em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-encyclicals"><a href="#fn-encyclicals">9</a></sup>. We live amongst a pantheon of great contemporary Biblical scholars and popularizers: Scott Hahn, John Bergsma, Brant Pitre, Jeff Cavins, Fr. Michael Schmitz, Bishop Robert Barron, Mary Healy, Mark Giszczak, and many others. The many wonderful Bibles and Bible study resources they and others have produced rightly deserve a place in your library<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-bibles"><a href="#fn-bibles">10</a></sup>. A Lectionary Bible helps compliment these other tools, and would fit well in that same library.  </p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Timothy that "One of the best things about being Catholic is that we are often a both/and faith...With all these options, it is great time to be a Catholic who loves the Bible."<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-tim"><a href="#fn-tim">11</a></sup></p>

<p>It is indeed a great time to be a Catholic who loves the Bible, and I hope to soon have a Lectionary Bible to add to my library—not to sit on the bookshelf but to accompany me as I seek to live the Mass and the Bible together.</p>
